Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
"When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War."
"Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations, a society where benders and non-benders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony."
They named the capital of this great land Republic City.
Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life.
"But sadly, his time in this world came to an end."
"And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew."
The White Lotus has honored my family by coming.
Thank you.
Welcome.
"We have investigated many claims, both here and in the Northern Tribe."
All have turned out to be false.
Then you should be happy to know your search has come to an end.
What makes you so sure your daughter is the one?
"Korra, please come in here."
I'm the Avatar. You got to deal with it.
She's strong.
She lacks restraint.
"Hey, why all the doom and gloom, people?"
We should be celebrating!
"Three elements down, one to go."
"You're getting ahead of yourself as usual, Korra."
We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet.
"Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ignored the spiritual side."
The Avatar must master both.
"I haven't ignored it, it just doesn't come as easy to me."
But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately.
He's Mr. Spiritual.
"Do you believe she's ready,"
Master Katara?
"Yes, if anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, it's Tenzin."
"Very well, Korra."
It's time for you to begin your airbending training.
Yes! Finally!
"I mean, thank you all for believing in me."
"Naga, you should've seen it."
I kicked some Firebender butt.
And I passed.
Tenzin will be here in a few days.
Just taking Naga out for a stroll.
"Don't worry, we're not going far."
"Naga, go! Thatta girl!"
"Go, go, go!"
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
It looks like we're there.
I know this. This is very familiar.
Are we here yet?
Are we here yet?
 Please tell me we're here!
" Yes, Ikki."
"As I've been telling you for the last 15 minutes, we are finally here."
"Hello, Mother."
I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.
Please... Help me.
"Unhand me, strange woman!"
"That's your grandmother, Meelo."
It's so good to see all of you.
"Gran-Gran, I've been reading all about your old adventures,"
I've been dying to ask you.
What happened to Zuko's mom?
"Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale..."
"Gran-Gran, you look old."
How old are you?
And why is it so cold in the South Pole?
"Can we make a campfire and all huddle around it, and tell scary stories and make snowmen?"
And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us?
Wouldn't that be fun? Wouldn't it?
"Pema, let me help you."
"Careful, now. Careful."
Stop doting on me.
"I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant."
The baby's strong.
I see another Airbender in your future.
All I want is one child like me.
"A nice non-bender, who doesn't blast wind in my face every five seconds."
"Mommy, look! I'm a Snowbender!"
Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?
"Kya and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin has always been rather serious."
"Mother, please."
Korra?
Look at you. So big and strong.
You've grown into quite the young Avatar.
"Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here."
I can't wait to get started.
"Yes, well."
You're going to have to tell her sooner or later.
"Wait, tell me what?"
"You're not staying, are you?"
I'm afraid not.
We're only visiting for the night.
Then I have to return to Republic City.
"But, no, you're supposed to move here."
You're supposed to teach me.
"I'm sorry, Korra."
Your airbending training is going to have to wait.
So how long until you're ready to teach me airbending?
A week? A month?
It could be much longer.
I don't understand.
Why are you making me wait?
I have a responsibility to Republic City.
I'm one of its leaders.
And the situation there is very unstable right now.
But you also have a responsibility to teach me.
"Believe me, I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one."
We're stuck with each other.
I wish there were another way.
"Wait, there is!"
"If you can't stay here, then I'll go back to Republic City with you."
It's perfect!
Absolutely not!
The city is far too dangerous.
Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements.
"I get that, but I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind."
"I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city."
Whatever.
"Goodbye, Gran-Gran."
"Oogi, yip yip."
"Nice night for an escape, isn't it?"
I have to leave.
I have to find my own path as the Avatar.
I know you do.
Aang's time has passed.
My brother and many of my friends are gone.
It's time for you and your generation to take on the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world.
And I think you're going to be a great Avatar.
Thank you.
"Goodbye, Korra."
"Mom, Dad..."
I'll miss you.
We love you so much.
"Naga, we're here!"
Thanks for the ride!
"Wow, look at this place."
I've never seen so many Sato-mobiles.
Air Temple Island.
That's where Tenzin lives.
"You ready for a little swim, girl?"
"Okay, okay!"
"Food first, then Air Temple."
"Watch it, Naga! Look out!"
Watch where you're going!
Sorry about that. Excuse us.
Coming through. Heads up.
"Sorry, we're new in town."
"Naga, wait."
"We'll take one of everything, please."
That'll be 20 yuans.
I don't have any money.
Then what good are you to me?
"Don't worry, girl. This city's huge."
I bet we can find a place to rustle up something to eat.
"Say, think I can get one of them tasty-smelling fishies?"
"Yeah, sure!"
So do you live in that bush?
"Yes, presently that is what I do call home."
Took me a while to procure a bush that beauteous.
This park is quite popular with all the vagabonds.
So there are a lot of you out here?
I thought everyone in this city was living it up.
"You got a lot to learn, newcomer."
Welcome to Republic City!
"Hey, you! Stop! You can't fish here!"
You best skedaddle!
Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders?
Then join the Equalists!
"For too long, the bending elite of this city have forced non-benders to live as lower-class citizens."
"Join Amon, and together we will tear down the bending establishment!"
What are you talking about?
Bending is the coolest thing in the world.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Let me guess, you're a bender."
"Yeah, I am."
"And I bet you'd just love to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?"
I'm seriously thinking about it.
This is what's wrong with the city.
Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us!
What?
I'm not oppressing anyone.
You're oppressing yourself.
That didn't even make sense.
"Excuse me, I think I'm lost."
How do I get to Air Temple Island from here?
Just head down this street...
"You should get moving, young lady."
It isn't safe.
"Mr. Chung, please tell me that you have my money, or else I can't guarantee"
I can protect your fine establishment.
I'm sorry.
Business has been slow. Please.
Take one of my phonographs.
My friend here is not a music lover.
"Give me the money, or else..."
"Or else what, hoodlum?"
"Since you're obviously fresh off the boat, let me explain a couple things."
"You're in Triple Threat Triad territory, and we're about to put you in the hospital."
You're the only ones who are going to need a hospital.
"And for your sake,"
I hope there's one nearby.
Who do you think you are?
Why don't you come and find out?
 What just happened?
 Did she just earthbend?
" Can she firebend, too?"
 Could she be...
"Got an idea about who I am now, chumps?"
Come on!
You're not getting away.
Police! Freeze where you are!
Cool. Metalbenders.
"I caught the bad guys for you, Officers."
Arrest them.
"You're under arrest, too."
What do you mean I'm under arrest?
Those are the bad guys over there.
They were smashing up a shop.
"From the looks of it, you smashed up a lot more than that."
"Wait, you can't arrest me."
Let me explain.
You can explain yourself all you like down at headquarters.
Let's see.
Multiple counts of destruction of private and city property.
Not to mention evading arrest.
"You're in a whole mess of trouble, young lady."
But there were some thugs threatening a helpless shopkeeper
 and I had to...
 Can it!
You should have called the police and stayed out of the way.
But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing.
It's my duty to help people.
"See, I'm the Avatar."
"Oh, I am well aware of who you are."
"And your ""Avatar"" title might impress some people, but not me."
All right. Fine.
Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge.
You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong.
Wait. Beifong?
Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!
What of it?
"Well, then why are you treating me like a criminal?"
Avatar Aang and your mother were friends.
They saved the world together.
That's ancient history.
And it's got diddly-squat to do with the mess you're in right now.
You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place.
Chief. Councilman Tenzin is here.
Let him in.
Tenzin.
"Sorry, I got a little sidetracked on my way to see you."
"Lin, you are looking radiant as usual."
"Cut the garbage, Tenzin."
Why is the Avatar in Republic City?
I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her.
My relocation has been delayed.
"The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately."
 Where she will stay put.
 But...
"If you would be so kind as to drop the charges against Korra,"
I will take full responsibility for today's regrettable events and cover all the damages.
Fine. Get her out of my city.
"Always a pleasure, Lin. Let's go, Korra."
"Tenzin, please."
Don't send me back home.
"You blatantly disobeyed my wishes, and the Orders of the White Lotus."
Katara agreed with me that I should come.
She said my destiny is in Republic City.
Don't bring my mother into this!
"Look, I can't wait any longer to finish my training."
Being cooped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar.
I saw a lot of the city today and it's totally out of whack.
I understand now why you need to stay.
Republic City does need you.
"But it needs me, too!"
"Is this your polar bear-dog, miss?"
 Korra!
 Korra!
Are you coming to live with us on the island?
"No, I'm sorry, Ikki."
I have to go home now.
Wait.
I have done my best to guide Republic City towards the dream my father had for it.
"But you are right, it has fallen out of balance since he passed."
I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy.
But you are his legacy.
You may stay and train airbending here with me.
Republic City needs its Avatar once again.
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!
"Hello? I'm Korra, your new Avatar."
Does this mean you've moved to Republic City?
Were you trying to send a message to the Triads yesterday?
Will you be fighting crime or the anti-bending revolution? Or both?
Will you be working with Chief Beifong and the police?
"Yes, I am definitely here to stay, but, honestly..."
I don't exactly have a plan yet.
"See, I'm still in training, but..."
"Look, all I know is Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the center of peace and balance in the world."
And I believe we can make his dream a reality.
I look forward to serving you.
I'm so happy to be here.
"Thank you, Republic City."
"All right, that's all the questions the..."
"Amon, how do you want to handle this?"
So the Avatar has arrived early.
It looks like we will have to accelerate our plans.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Republic City welcomes a new citizen into her arms.
Avatar Korra!
"After years of seclusion in the South, this master of water, earth and fire seeks to add airbending to her list of skills."
"And under the tutelage of Tenzin,"
"Avatar Aang's son, she should go far."
"But will this cool, calm, collected master of air be able to tame this hot-headed teen?"
"""And in the final round,"""
"""the Buzzard Wasps won,"""
"""with a decisive knockout."""
What do you say we go to the arena tonight?
Catch a few Pro-bending matches?
"That ""sport"" is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending."
"Come on, Tenzin."
"I've dreamed about seeing a Pro-bending match since I was a kid, and now I'm just a ferry ride away from the arena."
"Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel."
You're here to finish your Avatar training.
"So, for the time being,"
I want you to remain on the island.
"Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around,"
 to watch my every move?
 Yes.
"In order to learn airbending, I believe you require a calm, quiet environment, free from any distractions."
"All right, you're the master."
So my mother informed me that you've never been able to airbend before.
"Yeah, but I don't know why."
The other elements came so easily to me.
But every single time
I've tried airbending...
Nothing.
"That's perfectly all right, we just need to be patient."
"Often, the element that's the most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality."
"For Aang, it was earthbending."
"Yeah, well, I'm about as opposite an Airbender as you can get."
Let's begin your first lesson.
Korra's going to airbend!
Korra's going to airbend!
What is that contraption?
A time honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending.
"Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?"
The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them.
Seems easy enough.
Jinora forgot to say you have to make it through while the gates are spinning.
The key is to be like the leaf.
Flow with the movement of the gates.
Jinora will demonstrate.
Airbending is all about spiral movements.
"When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a moment's notice."
Let's do this.
Don't force your way through.
Dance! Dance like the wind!
Be the leaf!
Airbend!
What is wrong with me?
Airbend!
"Maybe I'm just not cut out to be an Airbender, huh, Naga?"
"Ladies and gentlemen,"
"I'm coming to you live from Republic City's Pro-bending Arena, where tonight, the best in the world continue their quest for a spot in the upcoming"
Championship Tournament.
"Grab your snacks and grab your kids, because this next match is going to be a doozy."
This Mako's got moxie!
"He advances, fires two quick shots."
Yomo is hammered back to Zone 3.
"The clock is winding down, can Yomo hold on?"
He's teetering on the edge of the ring now.
The Fire Ferrets line up to strike...
"Korra, come down here, please."
You shut it off at the best part!
I thought I made myself clear.
I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.
But it's their radio!
"And, technically, you said"
"I couldn't watch a match, you didn't say anything about listening to one."
You...
You know what I meant.
"Anyway, shouldn't you..."
Shouldn't you be in bed by now?
I think I'm doing it wrong.
There's nothing to do.
"Let your mind and your spirit be free, for air is the element of freedom."
Is something funny?
"Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom, but you won't even let me listen to the radio?"
And forget about leaving this island.
"Please, Korra. Look at Meelo."
He's able to meditate peacefully.
" Actually, I think he's asleep."
 What?
"Well, at least he has the relaxing part down."
Whatever. None of this airbending stuff makes any sense to me.
"I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time."
"Then one day, they'll just click."
"Yeah, it's not sinking in yet."
I'm going to go get a glass of lychee juice.
"Korra, the meditation's not over yet."
"Daddy, can I have some lychee juice, too?"
No.
"Hey, what are you doing in my gym?"
"Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost."
"Ah, the old ""I-had-to-pee"" excuse."
"You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids sneaking in without paying."
I'm taking you to security.
" No, wait..."
 There you are!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
"It's all right, Toza."
 She's with me.
" Yeah, I'm with him."
"So, you see, we're together."
"Well, not ""together' together."
"More like friends."""
"Right, friends."
"No, no, I didn't mean to imply..."
" Oh, you implied it."
I don't care what you are.
I've got work to do.
"Right this way, miss."
"Thank you, sir."
"Seriously, thanks!"
What do you think?
"Best seats in the house, huh?"
"Whoa, unbelievable!"
This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
" Name's Bolin, by the way."
 Korra.
Psst.
 Bolin.
 Yeah?
"I told you, you have to stop bringing your crazy fan girls in here before the matches. Get her out of here."
"Aww, come on, Mako."
"All right, look, I kind of promised her she could stay."
"But, man, I got a good feeling."
There's something special about her.
I know it. Come here.
"I want you to meet my brother, Mako."
Mako?
"Wow, I heard you play on the radio..."
"Come on, Bolin, we're up."
Or I could meet him later.
"Yeah, sorry about that."
My brother just gets real focused before a match.
"Okay, I got to go!"
Wish me luck. Not that I'll need it.
Good luck! Knock 'em out!
Introducing the Fire Ferrets!
"I love you, Bolin!"
The rookie Ferrets came from out of nowhere and have made it further than anyone expected this season.
"But tonight they face their toughest test yet, folks."
And they're off!
The two teams waste no time trying to blast each other out of Zone 1.
Hasook is the first to feel the heat of the Tigerdillos.
"He tries to return the favor, but they're too fast for him, while Mako showcases his trademark"
"""cool under fire"" style."
The Tigerdillos score with a walloping one-two combo.
Can their teammate hold on to their Zone 1 territory?
Guess not! Mako's over the line.
The Tigerdillos get the green light and advance into Ferret territory.
"Come on, Ferrets!"
 Looks like Hasook's in trouble.
"He's in Zone 3, teetering over the brink!"
And Hasook takes a dip!
"He'll be back for Round 2, assuming the fabulous bending brothers can hold their ground until the next round."
Round 1 goes to the Golden Temple Tigerdillos!
"Come on, Hasook, get your act together."
The Fire Ferrets are knocked into Zone 2 and the Tigerdillos advance.
The Fire Ferrets cinch the round in the closing seconds.
It's one apiece.
Still anyone's match as we go into the third and final round.
"Hasook stumbles and now he tumbles, right into his teammate."
He and Bolin better untangle quick if they don't want to...
"Oh, too late!"
"Oh, no!"
It's all up to Mako now.
He's bobbing and weaving.
He's weaving and bobbing.
But he's not hitting back.
"If Mako's knocked out, the Ferrets' fabulous season is over."
"He's dancing on the edge of the ring, surviving the three-on-one barrage."
It seems his plan is to let the Tigerdillos punch themselves out.
 And his plan is working!
Hahn is in the pool.
"They've got nothing left in the tank, and Mako is on the offensive!"
It's two-on-one.
Scratch that. It's one-on-one.
And it's an earth and fire slugfest!
There's so much smoke and dust from the fire fight...
I can't even see where the Fire Ferret is!
It's a knockout!
"What a wing-dinger of a hat trick, folks!"
"Mako pulls off the upset of the season, winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!"
Wahoo! Yes!
One more win and we're in the Championship Tournament.
"So what did you think, Korra?"
"Bolin's got some moves, huh?"
What did I think? What did I think?
That was amazing.
You did more harm than good out there.
You almost cost us the match.
" We won, didn't we?"
 Barely.
"Get off my case, pal!"
Ugh!
Useless.
You guys were incredible out there.
"Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick."
"Oh, you're still here?"
"Oh, you're still a jerk?"
Anyway.
"I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that."
It's like there's a whole new style here.
Think you could show me a few tricks?
 Absolutely.
 Right now?
"Come on, Bolin."
Just ignore him.
"Yeah, I can show you the basics."
"I'm just not sure how my earthbending would translate to your waterbending, but we'll figure it out."
Won't be a problem.
I'm actually an Earthbender.
I'm sorry!
"No, no, I didn't mean to assume."
"'Cause, you know, I was just figuring with your Water Tribe getup that you are a Water Tribe gal."
"No, you're right, I'm a Waterbender."
And a Firebender.
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
I'm very confused right now.
"You're the Avatar, and I'm an idiot."
Both are true.
No way.
The Avatar!
"All right, let's see what you got."
That was great! Good power.
But in a real match you'd be a sitting turtle-duck.
Not so upright and flat-footed.
Stay light on your toes.
Right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike.
Then. Pop! Pop!
"Okay, let me try it again."
Wow! Nice adjustment.
 You're a natural at this.
 Not bad.
What's it take to impress this guy?
"What? I said, ""Not bad."""
"You know what, it's getting late."
I think I'm going to turn in.
You kids have fun.
"Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra."
"Yeah, been a real pleasure."
"See you upstairs, bro."
Upstairs? You guys live here?
Yep. In the attic.
"It's nothing fancy, but we have some great views."
So back to bending.
Why don't you throw that combo one more time?
"Patience, Korra."
That was a 2000-year-old historical treasure.
What... What is wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me!
"I've been practicing, just like you taught me."
"But it isn't sinking in, okay?"
"It hasn't ""clicked"" like you said it would."
"Korra, this isn't something you can force."
If you would only listen to me...
I have been! But you know what I think?
Maybe the problem isn't me.
Maybe the reason
I haven't learned airbending yet is because you're a terrible teacher.
"Yeah, you're a terrible teacher, Daddy."
"Okay, everyone here?"
"Wait, where's Korra?"
"Honestly, Pema,"
I am at my wit's end with that girl.
I don't know how to get through to her!
"Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space."
You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this.
I will make no such promises.
"I didn't miss your match, did I?"
You guys look like you lost already.
We might as well have.
Hasook's a no-good no-show!
You got two minutes to come out ready to play or you're disqualified.
"Well, there goes our shot at the tournament."
And the winnings.
Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?
"No, the rules say you can only compete on one team."
"Well, then how about me?"
"I'm a top-notch Waterbender, if I do say so myself."
But you're the Avatar. Isn't that cheating?
It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending.
No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.
"Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence."
 Time's up. You in or out?
 We're in!
 We are?
 Yes!
"Hey, I didn't agree to this..."
You can thank me later.
This girl is crazy.
Looks like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted out a last-minute replacement Waterbender.
Let's see if she's another diamond in the rough like the brothers from the school of hard knocks.
Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive.
"In fact, don't do anything."
Just try not to get knocked off the ring.
"You got it, Captain."
"Players, are you ready?"
Man overboard!
"Fire Ferret Waterbender, penalty!"
Move back one zone!
What? Why?
"You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring, not over the sides."
Oh... Whoops.
And we're back in action after that hiccup.
But I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing.
Foul! Over the line.
Move back to Zone 3.
I'll show you over the line...
The Platypus Bears take Round 1.
"The Platypus Bears know a green player when they see one, and they are focusing the brunt of their bending on this poor girl."
Wait a minute.
Did that Waterbender just earthbend?
Foul. I think.
Did I see that right?
"Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but I think this replacement player could be..."
"Pardon me, everyone."
Have you seen Korra this evening?
She's not in her room.
You've got to be kidding me.
"She's the Avatar, folks!"
Playing in a Pro-bending match!
Can you believe that?
I'll get her myself.
The Avatar will be permitted to continue so long as she solely bends water.
"This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no Pro-bender."
And the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness.
They're giving her their best and her best ain't good enough to stop it!
And she's in the drink!
"Oh, hey, Tenzin."
I thought you didn't like coming to these matches.
"Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders."
You were to stay on the island. Let's go.
No. I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient.
But clearly the only thing you respond to is force.
So I am ordering you to come back to the temple. Right now.
Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending?
"You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it."
Because maybe I don't even need it.
What? That is a ludicrous suggestion.
The Avatar needs to learn airbending.
It is not optional.
No. This is what I need to learn.
Modern styles of fighting.
"Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra."
When will you learn that?
I have a match to go finish.
The Platypus Bears win Round 2.
Round 3!
The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers.
"They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of Zone 1, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue."
"And, boy, does she need it!"
Looks like the Avatar's Pro-bending debut is going to be cut short.
She's been pushed back to Zone 3 and the water is calling her name.
It's only a matter of time before...
"Hold the phone, stop the presses."
"She's still in the game, folks!"
And she's moving like an entirely different player!
All of a sudden the Platypus Bears' strikes are only striking air!
How about that?
"The Platypus Bears have no juice left, but Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy."
Knockout!
The Fire Ferrets come from way behind and steal the win.
"What an upset, folks."
"The rookies, Avatar in tow, have nabbed a place in the Championship Tournament!"
I cannot believe it.
 Yeah.
 Yes!
"Korra, what can I say?"
You really came alive in that last round.
The way you dodged their attacks.
You are a natural.
"Thanks, but I can't take all the credit."
Someone else taught me those moves.
I'm really sorry about everything I said.
I was really frustrated with myself and I took it out on you.
"I think I owe you an apology, too."
"I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine."
No hard feelings?
Of course not.
"By the way, you were really good out there tonight."
You moved just like an Airbender.
"Wait, you stayed and watched?"
I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you.
"I'll see you tomorrow for airbending practice, bright and early!"
"And by the way, I kind of permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks."
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
A chance encounter turns Korra from Pro-bending spectator to Pro-bending star!
"With her new teammates,"
"Mako and Bolin, the Fire Ferrets earn a place in the Championship Tournament!"
"But meanwhile, an anti-bending revolution brews in Republic City."
Who are the Equalists?
And what nefarious plan does the mysterious man behind the mask have in store for our hero?
What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning?
The morning is evil.
"We're the rookies, so we get the worst time slot in the gym."
And you're the rookiest of us all.
We gotta get you up to speed if we want to survive in the tournament.
Deal with it.
You deal with it.
"There are my little, hard workin' street urchins!"
"It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar."
And you are?
Butakha.
I run this whole Pro-bending shebang.
Here's your winnings from the last match.
Not so fast!
"First, you owe me for the Avatar's new gear..."
Gym and equipment rentals for last month...
Rent on your apartment...
And a personal loan for groceries.
What? I'm a growing boy!
"And one more small item of business, the Fire Ferrets need to ante up"
"30,000 yuans for the championship pot."
"30,000 yuans!"
"Sorry, kids."
"You got till the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else you're out of the tournament."
"You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account overflowing with gold, would you?"
I got nothing.
I've never really needed money.
I've always had people taking care of me.
Then I wouldn't say you have nothing.
Sorry. I didn't mean...
"No, it's all right. It's just..."
"Ever since we lost our parents, we've been on our own."
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
"So anyway, how are we gonna come up with the money?"
I got it! I got it!
I've been training Pabu to do circus tricks.
"Now, people would pay good money to see that!"
"Come on, Bolin, we need serious ideas."
I was serious.
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure something out.
I always do.
"Come one, come all!"
"See Pabu the Fantastic Fire Ferret as he crosses the Ladder of Peril, upside down!"
"Big finish, buddy! Stick the landing!"
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!"
"You are too kind. Seriously, too kind."
You can come back here and put money right in this...
"Okay, that's fine, that's fine."
"One yuan down, 29,999 to go."
"Hey, Bolin. Is that you?"
"Hey there, Shady Shin!"
Heard you're a big time
Pro-bending player now. Not bad!
Thanks.
"So listen, I got an offer for ya."
Lightning Bolt Zolt is looking to hire some extra muscle.
"I don't know, Shin."
Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats.
Your brother ain't the boss of you.
"It's just a little security work, nothin' crooked."
You game?
"Bo, I'm back."
Picked up your favorite dumplings.
"Hey, I found some work down at the power plant."
Made some decent money.
"Bolin? You here, bro?"
I bet the little love bird is making a house call.
Good! Light on your feet!
He's cute.
"Korra, is that the handsome"
Firebender boy that drives you crazy?
"Does he drive you crazy in a bad way, or does he drive you crazy like you like him?"
"Hey, Mako."
 You seen Bolin?
" Nice to see you, too."
"And, no,"
I haven't seen him since practice.
 Think something's wrong?
 I don't know.
Bolin has a knack for getting into stupid situations.
See you later.
"Wait, I could help you look for him."
"Nah, I got it."
"Hey, cool guy, let me help you."
We can take Naga.
 Who's Naga?
 My best friend.
And a great tracker.
Your best friend is a polar bear-dog.
Somehow that makes perfect sense.
"I'll take that as a compliment, city boy."
"Well, this is his usual hangout."
You guys seen my brother around here today?
Perhaps. My memory's a little foggy.
Maybe you can help clear it up.
"You're good, Skoochy. A real pro."
"Yeah, I seen him."
 When?
 About noon.
What was he doing?
He was performing some kind of monkey-rat circus.
And then...
And then what? Why'd he leave?
Shady Shin showed up and flashed some serious cash.
Bo took off with him in his hot rod.
"The Triple Threats, the Red Monsoons, the Agni Kais, all the Triads are muscling up for something real big."
Now that's all you're getting out of me!
What's he talking about?
"Sounds like there's a turf war brewing, and Bolin's about to get caught right in the middle of it."
So where are we headed?
The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters.
Hopefully Bolin is there and nothing's gone down yet.
Triple Threat Triad?
I beat up some of those yahoos when I got into town.
Why would Bolin get tangled up with...
"Whoa, Naga!"
That's Pabu!
"No, Naga. Pabu's a friend, not a snack."
We gotta hurry.
Something's not right.
There are usually thugs posted out front. We better be cautious.
Bolin? You in here?
Bolin!
Naga! Come!
I can't bend...
I can't bend!
Calm down. It'll wear off.
Those guys were Chi-blockers.
 They're Amon's henchmen.
 Amon?
That anti-bending guy with the mask?
"Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists."
What do they want with the Triple Threats?
"Whatever it is, can't be good."
I can't believe
Bolin got himself into this mess!
"Mako, we are going to save your brother."
I promise you that.
We've been out all night.
No sign of him.
We've gotta keep looking. But where?
I have an idea!
"The first day I got into town,"
I ran into an Equalist protestor over there.
And you think they'll know where Bolin is?
It's our only lead right now.
"So, why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?"
"Well, we used to do some work for them back in the day."
What? Are you some kind of criminal?
"No, you don't know what you're talking about!"
I just ran numbers for them and stuff.
"We were orphans, out on the street."
I did what I had to do to survive and protect my little brother.
I'm sorry.
It must have been really hard.
Can I ask...
What happened to your parents?
They were mugged by a Firebender.
He cut them down right in front of me.
I was eight.
Mako...
Bolin's the only family I have left.
If anything happened to him...
Equality now! Equality now!
We want equality now!
Non-benders of Republic City...
That's the guy.
Amon calls you to action!
Take back your city! It's time for...
It's you again!
"You cannot silence me, Avatar!"
Shut your yapper and listen up.
My friend got kidnapped by some Chi-blockers.
Where'd they take him?
I have no idea what you're talking about!
I think you do.
"""Witness the Revelation. Tonight. 9:00."""
What's this Revelation?
Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!
You better believe it concerns us.
Spill it.
"No one knows what the Revelation is, and I have no idea what happened to your friend."
"But if he's a bender, then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him."
Where's it happening?
Hey! What's going on over there?
The Avatar's oppressing us! Help!
Let's scram.
Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?
"Probably because they don't want just anyone waltzing into their big Revelation, whatever that is."
I bet the information is hidden on here somehow.
Look at the backs.
There's four different images.
"So, it's a puzzle?"
Yeah... Of a map!
Bingo! That must be where it's going down.
This is the place.
 What are you doing?
 We'll attract less attention this way.
This is a private event.
No one gets in without an invitation.
Invitation...
You mean this?
"The Revelation is upon us, my brother and sister."
"I knew a lot of people hated benders, but I've never seen so many in one place."
Keep your eyes out for Bolin.
"Please welcome your hero, your savior,"
Amon!
My quest for equality began many years ago.
"When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm."
We weren't rich.
And none of us were benders.
This made us very easy targets for the Firebender who extorted my father.
"One day, my father confronted this man, but when he did, that Firebender took my family from me..."
"Then, he took my face."
I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.
"As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City."
"And if she were here, she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world."
But she is wrong.
The only thing bending has brought to the world is suffering.
It has been the cause of every war in every era.
But that is about to change.
"I know you have been wondering, what is the Revelation?"
You are about to get your answer.
"Since the beginning of time, the Spirits have acted as guardians of our world."
And they have spoken to me.
They say the Avatar has failed humanity.
That is why the Spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance.
"They have granted me a power that will make equality a reality, the power to take a person's bending away..."
Permanently.
That's impossible. There's no way...
This guy's insane.
"Now, for a demonstration."
"Please welcome Lightning Bolt Zolt, leader of the Triple Threat Triad and one of the most notorious criminals in Republic City."
"""Boo"" yourself!"
 There's Bolin!
 Wait.
We can't fight them all.
We need to be smart about this.
"Then come up with a game plan, team captain."
"Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing non-benders, but his reign of terror is about to come to an end!"
"Now, in the interest of fairness,"
I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending.
"You're gonna regret doing that, pal."
What did you do to me?
Your firebending is gone. Forever.
The era of bending is over.
A new era of equality has begun!
Any ideas yet?
I think so. See those machines?
They're powered by water and steam.
"If you create some cover,"
I can grab Bolin without anyone seeing.
" Then, we duck out of here."
 Works for me.
"Mako, good luck."
"You, too."
It's not enough.
"Hey, you!"
"Is there a problem, my brother?"
What are you doing back here?
Looking for the bathroom?
Come on...
Thanks. This should be enough.
"Hello, Amon, sir."
I think there's been a big misunderstanding...
"Bolin, you all right?"
Yes! Mako! I love you!
"You benders need to understand, there's no place in the world for you anymore."
I wouldn't count us out just yet.
Naga!
I want to be on your back.
The Avatar. That's her!
Let her go.
She's the perfect messenger to tell the city of my power.
Thank goodness!
I was just about to send out a search party. Are you all right?
"Korra, what happened?"
 Did you find your friend?
" Yes, but..."
I was at an Equalist rally. I saw Amon.
What?
He can take people's bending away.
 For good.
 That's...
That's impossible.
Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.
But I saw him do it.
I believe you.
"I don't know how Amon has achieved this power, but this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever."
No bender is safe.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
"Benders, be on alert!"
"After coming face to face with Amon, leader of the Equalists,"
Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth!
"This masked madman has the ability to take away a person's bending, permanently!"
Benders of Republic City are counting on their young Avatar.
But is she prepared to face such a frightening foe?
"After I take your bending away, you will be nothing!"
"It's all right, Naga."
I just had a bad dream.
"There is a madman running around our beloved city, threatening to tear it apart."
We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice.
Absolutely not.
A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and non-benders.
"Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal."
But who would even head up such a task force?
It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.
"This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, isn't it?"
All I'm trying to do is help. Think back.
"Forty-two years ago,"
"Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man,"
Yakone.
Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head on.
This is a completely different situation.
And how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!
Amon is not going to stop with the bending Triads.
"Eventually he will come for all us benders, our friends, our families."
Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late.
All in favor?
"Good evening, my fellow Equalists."
"This is your leader, Amon."
"As you have heard, the Republic Council has voted to make me public enemy number one, proving once again that the bending oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution."
"But we cannot be stopped, our numbers grow stronger by the day."
You no longer have to live in fear.
The time has come for benders to experience fear.
No! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you!
How could you not see me?
"I mean, I was..."
"I was, I... I... That was..."
Are you okay? Did I hurt you?
I am such an idiot.
"Don't worry, I'm fine."
My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice.
"Wait, I recognize you."
"You're Mako, right?"
You play for the Fire Ferrets!
"Yeah, that's me."
I am so embarrassed!
My name's Asami.
Let me make this up to you somehow.
How about I treat you to dinner?
"Tomorrow night, 8:00, Kwong's Cuisine."
Kwong's?
I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy.
I'll take care of that.
All you need to do is show up.
"So, it's a date?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
I'll see you tomorrow night.
"We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion and..."
"I'm not interrupting, am I?"
"This is my home, Tarrlok."
We're about to eat dinner.
"Good, because"
I am absolutely famished.
"Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right?"
I suppose.
You must be the famous Avatar Korra.
It is truly an honor.
"I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe."
Nice to meet you.
Why do you have three ponytails?
And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.
"Well, aren't you precocious?"
"So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers."
"Infiltrating Amon's rally, now, that took some real initiative."
Thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in this city who's happy I'm here.
Republic City is much better off now that you've arrived.
"Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok."
What do you want from Korra?
"Patience, Tenzin, I'm getting to that."
"As you may have heard,"
"I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution, and I want you to join me."
 Really?
 What?
"I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger, and that someone is you."
Join your task force?
I can't.
"I must admit, I'm rather surprised."
I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon.
"Me, too."
I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin.
"Right now, I just need to focus on that."
Which is why this opportunity is perfect.
You would get on-the-job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city.
Korra gave you her answer.
It's time for you to go.
Very well.
But I'm not giving up on you just yet.
You'll be hearing from me soon.
"It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra."
"Bye-bye, ponytail man!"
"Welcome to Kwong's Cuisine,"
Master Mako.
"""Master""?"
The scarf stays.
"As you wish, sir. This way, please."
I am such a big Pro-bending fan.
I caught all of your matches this season.
All of them?
"Honestly, there were a few"
I wish you hadn't seen.
Don't be ridiculous. You're amazing!
I can't wait to see you play in the tournament.
"Yeah, well... Maybe next year."
What do you mean? You made it in.
It just isn't in the cards for us right now.
"Tell me, what's the problem?"
We don't have the cash to ante up for the championship pot.
"So, it looks like we're out of the running."
That's not fair.
"Pardon me, Miss Sato."
Your main course.
Miss Sato?
"You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Sato-mobile?"
" Yeah, he's my dad."
 Get out of town!
I'm serious. You want to meet him?
Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City?
"Yeah, I'll take you up on that."
"Hello, fellow teammate!"
"Hey, Bolin."
Missed you at practice this week.
"Yeah, sorry about that."
"It's all right. We're probably out of the tournament anyway, unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow."
"Anyway, reason I came by was to give you this."
Thanks. What's this for?
I can't remember now.
"Yeah, now I remember."
You saved me from Amon.
That? It was no big deal.
No big deal? Are you serious?
"I was totally freaking out when he was coming at me with his creepy mask, all,"
"""I will take away your bending forever!"""
"I mean, that is scary stuff."
I still can't sleep well.
Delivery for Avatar Korra!
Tarrlok sends his compliments and urges you to reconsider his offer.
Tell him I haven't changed my mind.
Who's this Tarrlok guy?
Is he bothering you?
'Cause I could have a word with him.
"No, it's not like that."
He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the Council.
"Good, good. That sounds better."
I like that better.
What do you think of my little operation here?
"It's very impressive, Mr. Sato."
"Please, call me Hiroshi."
" So, I understand you're dirt poor."
 Well...
"Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of."
"I, too, came from humble beginnings."
"Why, when I was your age,"
I was a mere shoe shiner.
And all I had to my name was an idea...
The Sato-mobile.
"Now, I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic."
He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground.
"And I built the entire Future Industries empire from that one, selfless loan."
"Dad, stop bragging."
Just tell Mako the good news.
What good news?
"Well, my daughter passionately told me all about your hard-earned success in the Pro-bending Arena, and about your team's current financial stumbling block."
"Now I'd hate to see you lose your chance at winning the championship, just because you're short a few yuans."
That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!
 Are you serious?
 He's serious!
My dad's going to cover your ante for the championship pot.
That... That is good news!
"There's just one catch, you all have to wear the Future"
Industries logo on your uniforms.
"I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, sir!"
Thank you both so much!
I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity!
"Out of the way, Daddy!"
We're driving here!
I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant.
"Yeah, that guy doesn't know how to take no for an answer."
"Korra, are you doing all right?"
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Why don't you take a break?
"I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok, but I just wanted to make sure your decision was for the right reason."
I'm just really focused on my airbending right now is all.
"Right, that's what you said."
"You know, it's okay to be scared."
The whole city is frightened by what's been going on.
The important thing is to talk about our fears.
"Because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance."
"I'm always here for you, if you want to talk."
"Avatar Korra, I have something for you."
"It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends,"
I'm not joining his task force.
"It's not a gift, it's an invitation!"
To what?
Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor.
All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there.
The Councilman humbly requests your attendance.
I can't believe this is all for me.
"I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting, but keep your guard up."
It's not like him to throw a party just for the fun of it.
"So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra."
"If you'll excuse us, the city awaits its hero."
"Meelo, no! That is not a toilet! Oh, dear."
"Korra, it is my pleasure to introduce"
"Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato."
Nice to meet you.
We're all expecting great things from you.
Right. Greatness.
"Hey, Korra."
"This is my daughter, Asami."
It's lovely to meet you.
Mako told me so much about you.
Really? Because he hasn't mentioned you at all.
How did you two meet?
Asami crashed into him on her moped.
What? Are you okay?
I'm fine. More than fine!
Mr. Sato agreed to sponsor our team.
We're back in the tournament!
Isn't that great?
"Yeah, terrific."
"Chief Beifong, I believe you and"
Avatar Korra have already met.
"Just because the city's throwing you this big to-do, don't think you're something special."
You've done absolutely nothing to deserve this.
"If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple questions."
But...
"Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand."
How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?
I think... He presents a real problem.
Then why have you refused to join
Tarrlok's task force?
"As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?"
Well... I...
Why are you backing away from this fight?
What? No. I've never backed away from anything in my life.
You promised to serve this city.
Aren't you going back on that promise now?
Do you think Pro-bending is more important than fighting the revolution?
How do you think
Avatar Aang would have handled this?
Are you afraid of Amon?
I'm not afraid of anybody!
"If the city needs me, then..."
I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.
"There's your headline, folks!"
"My fellow task force deputies, tonight we will execute a raid on an underground Chi-blocker training camp located in the Dragon Flats borough."
"According to my sources, there is a cellar underneath this bookstore where Equalists train Chi-blocking in secret."
I'm going after those two!
"Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok."
"We make a good team, Avatar."
"Yeah, we do!"
No Korra for practice again?
Doesn't look like it.
Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action.
"With the two of us leading the charge,"
Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists!
Question for the Avatar.
Amon remains at large.
Why have you failed to locate him?
You wanna know why?
Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward!
"Amon, I challenge you to a duel!"
"No task force, no Chi-blockers."
"Just the two of us, tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island."
"Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing, if you're man enough to face me!"
"I know it sounds weird to say this, but I'm really glad I hit you with my moped."
"Me, too."
"I forgot to ask, why didn't you accept the new silk scarf"
I bought for you last week?
 You didn't like it?
" No, it was really nice. But..."
"This scarf was my father's, and it's all I have left of him."
I just feel like... Like it keeps me safe.
I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young.
I feel so safe with you.
"Korra, this is madness."
"Don't try to stop me, and don't follow me!"
I have to face Amon alone.
This is all your doing!
"I tried to talk her out of it, too, but she's made up her mind."
We'll be watching the island closely.
"If anything goes wrong,"
I have a fleet of police airships ready to swoop down.
"Guess you're a no-show, Amon."
Who's scared now?
"I received your invitation, young Avatar."
"Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature."
"Although it would be the simplest thing for me to take away your bending right now,"
I won't.
You'd only become a martyr.
Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise.
"But I assure you, I have a plan, and I'm saving you for last."
"Then you'll get your duel, and I will destroy you."
 Aang...
 Korra!
"Korra, are you all right?"
What happened? Was Amon here?
Yeah. He ambushed me.
Did he...
Did he take your bending away?
No. I'm okay.
Thank goodness.
I was so terrified! I felt so helpless!
"It's all right, the nightmare is over."
You... You were right.
I've been scared this whole time.
I've never felt like this before and...
"Tenzin, I don't know what to do!"
Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Love is in the air!
"Since Avatar Korra has arrived in Republic City, she's only had eyes for one fellow, Mako."
The feeling seemed mutual until a fateful accident intervened.
"Now, Mako's affections have fallen right into the arms of the beautiful Asami."
Will love prove to be Korra's most formidable foe yet?
"It's been great having you at so many back-to-back practices, Korra."
"Feels good to be back, although Tarrlok isn't too happy about my leave of absence."
"Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets before you joined his task force."
"Okay, come on, team huddle time!"
It's our first match of the tournament tonight.
"I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the Fire Ferrets have never been this good."
 Are we ready?
 We're ready!
Not quite. You'll need these!
" Hey, Asami."
" Good morning, sweetie."
 These new uniforms look great!
" You look great, champ!"
"Well, teammates,"
"I'll see you before the match tonight,"
Asami and I have a lunch date.
"Okay, we'll check you guys later, you know, we'll see you when we see you."
"So, Korra..."
"There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym."
Just you and me.
"Two alone people, together."
Alone.
I gotta head back to the Air Temple to train with Tenzin. See you!
"Work with me here, Pabu!"
"You want to look spick and span in your new uniform, don't you?"
"So what do you think of Korra, in a girlfriend sort of way?"
She's great!
But I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami.
I was talking about a girlfriend for me!
Leave some ladies for the rest of us!
"I know, that's what I thought you meant."
 Well?
" I don't know, Bo."
It doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra.
You just said she was great two seconds ago.
"Yeah, Korra is a great athlete and Avatar and stuff, but..."
I don't know if she is really
"""girlfriend material."""
 She's more like a pal.
" Bro, you're nuts!"
Korra and I are perfect for each other!
"She's strong, I'm strong."
"She's fun, I'm fun."
"She's beautiful, I'm gorgeous!"
"Okay, I don't care what you think,"
I'm gonna ask Korra out.
"Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament."
Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight.
 Okay?
" Yeah, yeah, I know!"
"You know what I'm talking about, Pabu."
Talking about real love...
"So how's it going with the tall, dreamy Firebender boy?"
You've been spending a lot of time together lately.
"Yeah, tell us all about the magical romance."
"What? Listen to you two,"
I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff.
"Besides, he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl."
But let's just pretend for a second
"I am interested in him, what would I do?"
"I just read a historical saga, where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general's son, who's supposed to marry the princess."
 You should do what she did.
 Tell me!
"She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country, then she jumped into a volcano."
It was so romantic.
"No, no, no!"
"The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly into a magical castle in the sky, where they get married and eat clouds with spoons, and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch."
For ever and ever and ever!
The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now.
"Hey, Pema."
How long were you standing there?
Long enough.
"But trust me,"
I know what you're going through.
"Years ago, I was in the exact same situation with Tenzin."
Daddy was in love with someone else before you?
 That's right.
 So what did you do?
"Well, for the longest time, I did nothing."
I was so shy and scared of rejection...
But watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful.
So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin.
And the rest is history.
"Folks, after a year of waiting, the Pro-bending championship tournament is finally here."
Tonight is the first set of matches in our single elimination
16 team bracket.
"And I gotta tell you, these are the most tenacious and talented bending trios this arena has ever seen."
"Introducing our first team, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!"
"And their opponents, the Red Sands Rabbiroos."
What an explosive opening volley!
Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending.
I am astonished with the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets.
No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately.
She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym.
"The Ferrets advance into Rabbiroo territory, and they're holding nothing back."
"Nice sprawl there by Mako,"
"Bolin strikes, Ula dodges and all three Rabbiroos are down!"
The Fire Ferrets easily take round one.
Round two!
"The Rabbiroos are looking for payback, and they go straight after Bolin."
"Korra comes to his defense, and she water-whacks"
Umi back into zone two!
"The Ferrets are on fire tonight, and they win round two."
Round three!
"With the Rabbiroos down two rounds, they'll need a knockout to win, and with the way the Fire Ferrets are playing,"
I don't see that happening.
These Ferrets are working together like a well-oiled bending machine.
"Bolin bashes Adi back into zone two, and the Ferrets get the green light to advance."
The Rabbiroos are just fighting to stay on their feet at this point.
"Down goes Adi, and Ula and Umi!"
"All three rounds go to the Future Industries Fire Ferrets, who win their opening match of the tournament!"
 Yes!
 That's what I'm talking about!
" Thank you, thank you very much!"
" Wow, we were really connecting"
 out there in that ring!
 Yeah!
"You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well"
" out of the ring, too."
 Sure.
"So, I was thinking we should spend some time together."
We've been spending lots of time together.
"I mean, outside of the gym."
And not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting Chi-blockers.
I don't know.
 Asami and I...
" Look, I really like you, and I think we were meant for each other."
"Korra, I'm really sorry, but..."
I just don't feel the same way about you.
Forget I ever said anything.
"Congratulations, guys!"
You were so amazing out there.
"So, Korra, I was thinking..."
"You and me, we could go get some dinner together..."
Sort of a date situation.
"That's really sweet, but I don't think so."
 I don't feel very date-worthy.
 Are you kidding me?
"You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!"
You really feel that way about me?
I felt that way since the moment I saw you.
"Trust me, I know we're gonna have so much fun together."
You know what? I could use some fun.
" Okay, sure."
 Yes!
Who's the luckiest guy in the world?
"Right here, Bolin!"
 So how'd you like it?
 It's delicious!
And totally authentic.
I didn't realize how much I missed
Water Tribe grub.
"That's great,"
'cause this is my favorite joint.
"See? You love Water Tribe food,"
"I love Water Tribe food, just another reason we are so great together."
They are good noodles!
"Hey, who's that creepy guy over there that keeps glaring at us?"
That's Tahno and the Wolf-bats.
"Reigning champs, three years running."
Don't make eye contact.
Here he comes.
"Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude."
"Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets."
Pro-bending's saddest excuse for a team.
"Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament?"
"Especially you, Avatar."
"You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends,"
I could give you some private lessons.
"You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?"
Go for it. I'll give you the first shot.
"Korra, don't."
"He's just trying to bait you. If you hit him, we're out of the tournament."
I've never seen someone razz Tahno like that.
"You are one of a kind, Korra."
 What kind of game are you playing?
 Pro-bending?
 We've got a quarterfinal match.
" No, I mean with Bolin."
You've got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me.
"I am not, we're just having fun together."
" What do you care, anyway?"
 I'm looking out for my little brother.
 I don't wanna see his heart get broken.
 Wait a second.
You're not worried about him.
You're jealous!
 You do have feelings for me.
" What? ""Jealous""?"
Don't be ridiculous.
"Admit it, you like me."
No. I'm with Asami!
"Yeah, but when you're with her, you're thinking about me, aren't you?"
 Get over yourself!
 I'm just being honest!
 You're crazy!
 You're a liar!
"Hey, Mako..."
"Eight teams have been eliminated and eight advance into the quarterfinals, which get under way tonight."
"The rookies are about to take on the former and longest reigning champs, the Boar-Q-pines."
"Youth clashes against experience in a battle for the ages, or rather, of the ages."
Korra dodges and slams right into her teammate!
"Down goes Mako, and Bolin and Korra!"
Round one goes to the Boar-Q-pines!
You were supposed to defend while I attacked!
"I had an opening, so I took it!"
What is up with you two?
"All right, whatever, just pull it together, guys."
The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two.
Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks.
He's a one man bending battalion.
"The Ferrets having a tough time finding their rhythm tonight, but thanks to Bolin, they narrowly notch round two."
"Not sure what's eating them, but this is not the same team who took out the Rabbiroos."
Round three is a tie!
We go to a tie-breaker to decide the match.
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!
 Which element do you choose?
 I got this.
"I know you usually handle these, but frankly, your head's not in the game."
I'm gonna take this one.
We choose earth.
Looks like the Earthbenders will collide in the tie-breaker face-off.
Bolin goes in for the grapple.
Chang reverses.
"Bolin strikes from midair, knocking"
Chang to the edge of the circle.
"Another strike from Bolin, and Chang's in the drink!"
The Future Industries Fire Ferrets win their quarterfinal match!
"That was a close one, folks."
Youth trumps experience tonight.
We need to talk.
"Look, sometimes you can be so infuriating. I..."
Save your breath.
You've already made it clear how you feel about me.
"No, I haven't."
"What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy,"
I also think you're pretty amazing.
" So, you do like me?"
 Yes! But...
"I like Asami, too."
"I don't know, things are complicated."
I've been feeling really confused...
"Bolin, this isn't what you think."
 Great! Look what you did!
 You're blaming me?
 You kissed me!
 You kissed me back!
"Well played, Korra."
"Morning, Narook. My brother here?"
Thanks.
"Come on, wake up."
"Taking you home, bro."
Don't call me that.
You're not my brother!
You're a brother betrayer!
The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu.
Pabu loves me.
"You're a mess, and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight."
 Let's go.
 No!
I'm not going anywhere with you!
You traitor!
Guess I'll have to do this the hard way.
Why?
I told you dating a teammate was a bad idea.
You're a bad idea!
Put me down!
"You can't find two teams more evenly matched in age, size and strength than the Fire Ferrets and the Buzzard Wasps."
"Believe me, I've looked!"
"This should be a pulse-pounding semifinal, folks!"
The Buzzard Wasps open with a flawlessly executed combo!
All three Ferrets take an early visit to zone two!
And Mako's knocked all the way back into zone three!
The Fire Ferrets have been struggling to stay alive since the opening bell.
All three players are totally out of sync tonight.
That has got to sting!
And Bolin loses his noodles.
"Literally! Which reminds me, this match is brought to you by our sponsor,"
Flamey-O Instant Noodles.
Noodliest noodles in the United Republic!
The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory.
And Mako plunges into the pool!
Can the Fire Ferrets hold on?
The Wasps have the Ferrets backed up to the edge now.
And the Ferrets are bailed out by the bell!
"They had better pull themselves together, folks, for round two, otherwise they can kiss the finals good-bye!"
Hey! Watch it!
"The Wasps take advantage of Mako's unforced error, and Bolin's in the pool!"
And a blatant hold by the Avatar!
Unnecessary roughness!
Move back one zone!
I'll unnecessarily rough you up!
And the Avatar is slapped with the yellow fan!
The Ferrets are their own worst enemy right now.
It's just sad to watch.
"With the Buzzard Wasps leading two rounds to zilch, the Ferrets' only hope of winning is with a knockout."
"Well, I guess there's always next year."
"Come on, we still have a chance, even if it is a slim one."
"The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals."
"Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team,"
 we'll never forgive ourselves.
 Let's just get this over with.
"The sooner, the better."
"Bolin's knocked into zone two, followed quickly by his brother."
And Bolin takes a zinger to the shoulder.
Looks like it's a clean hit.
Bolin!
Mako's in the drink and out of the match.
And Bolin keeps playing with one good arm!
"I got to hand it to him, this kid's got grit."
But how long can he keep it up?
"Apparently, not very long."
The Ferrets' dream of making it to the finals now rests in the Avatar's hands.
"But with three on one,"
I don't like her odds.
Are you okay? How's your shoulder?
It's messed up pretty bad.
But I think I'll be all right.
Are we gonna be all right?
Of course we are. We're brothers.
We'll get through this mess.
 I'm sorry.
" Me, too."
 Girls.
 Seriously.
What an unbelievable effort here by Korra.
She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her.
"The Avatar finally gains some ground, but with only 10 seconds remaining, it might be too little, too late."
It's the big kabosh! What a knockout!
 Yes!
 We did it!
Yes!
"It didn't seem possible, folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!"
" Shoulder, shoulder!"
 Sorry!
That was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Thanks for not giving up on us.
We never would have made it this far without you.
I owe you. Big time.
You're welcome.
So...
I know things are confusing right now.
 But I hope we can still be friends.
 Definitely.
You boys smell something in here?
"Wait, I know what that is."
"Yeah, that's the scent of losers."
I hope we see you in the finals.
Then we'll see who the losers really are.
Yeah.
I'm peeing in my pants over here.
"And now, the defending champs, the White Falls Wolf-bats!"
Great job!
"What a comeback, Korra!"
 I've never seen a hat trick like that.
 Thanks.
"But if it hadn't been for you and your father, we wouldn't have had the chance to play."
"So, thank you."
"If everyone's done with the little thank you party,"
I need some medical attention over here!
Let me help!
"Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?"
"Relax, I'm a healer."
"I learned from Katara, the best there is."
"No, no, no, no..."
That's the stuff.
"Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings."
I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand.
I'll be all right.
" But we had fun together, didn't we?"
" I had a great time, honestly!"
"You are one of a kind, Bolin."
"Please, go on. I enjoy praise."
Your winners!
The Wolf-bats!
What? How is it over already?
"With a brutal round one knockout, the defending champs secure their spot in the finals."
"I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor, because they're gonna need one!"
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
"After a close encounter with Amon,"
Korra took a leave of absence from Tarrlok's task force.
"But the Avatar has still been hard at work, leading the underdog Fire Ferrets to the Pro-bending championship finals."
"Only one team stands in their way, the Wolf-bats."
"Led by team captain Tahno, the brutal Wolf-bats look to repeat as champs."
Have the Fire Ferrets finally met their match?
"You are listening to the Music Hour, brought to you by Cabbage Corp."
Republic City's trusted name in technology for over 50 years.
"Man, I got a good feeling about tonight!"
"I don't care if we are the underdogs, we can take those pompous Wolf-bats."
"It's going to be our toughest match ever, but I think you're right."
"Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!"
"Good morning, citizens of Republic City."
This is Amon.
I hope you all enjoyed last night's
"Pro-bending match, because it will be the last."
It's time for this city to stop worshipping bending athletes as if they were heroes.
"I am calling on the Council to shut down the bending Arena and cancel the finals, or else there will be severe consequences."
That guy's got some nerve!
You think the Council will give in?
I'm not waiting to find out.
We need to get to City Hall.
"Korra, you shouldn't be here."
This is a closed meeting.
"As the Avatar, and a Pro-bending player, I have a right to be heard."
You can't cancel the finals.
"I know winning the Championship means a lot to you, but as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the Arena down."
What about the rest of you?
"Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?"
"Actually, Tenzin and I agree, for once."
The Council is unanimous.
We're closing the Arena.
 No!
 You can't!
I don't understand.
I thought you of all people would take a stand against Amon.
"While I am still committed to bringing that lunatic to justice,"
"I will not put innocent lives at stake, just so you and your friends can play a game."
"Pro-bending might only be a game to you, but think of what it means to the city."
Right now the Arena is the one place where benders and non-benders gather together in peace
 to watch benders...
 Beat each other up in peace!
It's an inspiration to everyone!
"I appreciate your naive idealism, but you're ignoring the reality of the situation."
"The reality is, if you close the Arena, you let Amon win!"
"Yes, exactly what she said! Yes."
"I'm sorry, but our decision has been made."
This meeting is adjourned.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with the Avatar."
 You do?
" Yeah, you do?"
"I expected this kind of cut and run response from Tenzin, but the rest of you?"
"Come on, show a little more backbone."
It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.
We must prevent the conflict between benders and non-benders from escalating into all-out war!
"The Council is not changing its position, Lin."
"Now, just a moment, Tenzin."
Let us hear what our esteemed
Chief of Police has in mind.
"If you keep the Arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the Championship match."
There's no better force to deal with the Chi-blockers.
Our armor is impervious to their attacks.
Are you saying that you will personally take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the Arena?
I guarantee it.
It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record.
"If she is confident her elite officers can protect the Arena, then she has my support."
I am changing my vote.
Who else is with me?
The Arena stays open.
Good luck in the finals.
 All right!
 Thank you!
"And good luck to you, Chief Beifong."
"A word, please, Lin."
"Tarrlok's playing you, and I don't want to see you get hurt."
I know what I'm doing and the risks that come with it.
"In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match."
You don't need to babysit me.
It's for Korra.
I want to make sure she's safe.
Do what you want. It's not like
I've ever been able to stop you before.
"Excuse me, Chief Beifong?"
I wanted to thank you for your help.
It really means a lot.
What is her deal?
"Even when she's on my side, she's against me."
I've known Lin since we were children.
She's always been challenging.
What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?
My father and Lin got along famously.
I'm afraid her issues are with me.
Wait a second.
It all makes sense now!
"You and Beifong, Beifong and you."
You two were a couple!
What? How...
Where'd you get that idea?
Your wife.
Criminy!
I'll have to have a word with her.
So Pema stole you from Beifong?
I'm surprised our esteemed Chief of Police didn't throw her in jail.
"Oh, she tried."
"Anyway, Pema didn't ""steal"" me."
Lin and I had been growing apart for some time.
We both had different goals in life...
Why am I even telling you this?
It all happened a long time ago and we've moved past it.
Apparently Beifong hasn't.
What do you... Of course she has...
"Anyway, this is none of your business!"
"See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!"
I just got word.
The Council defied your threat.
They're keeping the Arena open.
Perfect.
Everything is going according to plan.
"All clear, Chief."
 How is the security sweep going?
 Fine.
They've checked underneath the stands?
Yes.
And you have enough officers to cover all points of entry?
"I have the skies, the bay, and every nook and cranny of this place covered."
Now leave me alone and let me do my job.
"Lin, with so much on the line, it would be nice if we could help each other out, at least for one night."
 Like old times?
 Like old times.
"Okay, I'll try to be less abrasive than usual."
I would appreciate that.
The anticipation is palpable as we are just moments away from the Championship match.
"Will the Wolf-bats' ferocity help them repeat as Champs, or will the underdog"
Fire Ferrets serve up a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?
"Now I know there's a big crowd, but don't be nervous, you're gonna do great."
I believe in you.
"Introducing the challengers, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!"
"You're on, Pabu!"
Yes! Nailed it! He's so talented.
"And their opponents, the three-time defending champions, the White Falls Wolf-bats!"
"They got nothing on us, buddy."
Anybody can howl.
Whatever.
I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid hair off his stupid head.
The champs and challengers face off at the center line.
And here we go!
Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's clock with some dirty water-boxing!
Ming shakes off Mako's attack and returns the favor.
"Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets a disk off the ropes and says,"
"""No thank you, sir!"""
Nice shot!
"The waterbenders slug it out, looking evenly matched."
Tahno gets a little too worked up and unleashes a deluge on Bolin that will certainly elicit a foul...
Or apparently not!
"What's the big idea, ref?"
That was a hosing foul!
And the Wolf-bats advance despite Tahno exceeding the waterbending time limit.
A questionable call by the officials.
Ming trips up Mako with another dirty trick!
"Come on, refs!"
There was some funny business in that last play!
Wouldn't have guessed you knew the rules of Pro-bending.
I've been brushing up.
That Wolf-bat blatantly bent a disk outside of his zone.
The Ferret brothers are backed up to Zone 3 and the Wolf-bats smell blood.
"Looks like Tahno snuck in an illegal icing move, but once again there's no call."
"I don't know what match the refs are watching, but it's obviously not this one."
A splash and crash send the Avatar to Zone 3 as well!
It's a knockout!
The Wolf-bats win the championship for the fourth year in a...
"Hold on a second, folks!"
Scratch that. The Ferrets are still alive!
But just barely!
What an unbelievable move!
"These Ferrets aren't just bending the elements, they're bending my mind!"
The underdogs survive to see round two!
 What's wrong with these refs?
 They've been paid off.
It's the only explanation.
Someone wants us to lose.
"If the Wolf-bats are going to fight dirty, then so should we."
"No, we can't. The refs have it out for us."
"If we're going to win this thing, it has to be fair and square."
"That's no fun, but all right."
Round two!
The opening salvo is a brutal brawl as both sides give it their all!
"But once again, Tahno sneaks in a little ice to get the upper hand."
Those look like illegal headshots to me!
Round two will be decided with a tiebreaker!
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!
Which element do you choose?
I'm taking this one.
"Let's go! You and me, pretty boy."
I thought you'd never ask.
"Come on, little girl."
Give me your best shot.
Chump.
Round two goes to the Fire Ferrets!
 Nice one!
 That's the stuff!
You are my hero!
We might actually win this thing!
Let's send them to a watery grave.
I can't believe your sweet-tempered father was reincarnated into that girl.
She's tough as nails.
Reminds me of someone else
I knew at that age.
"You two might get along, if you would only give her a chance."
One round a piece! Who wants it more?
"The Wolf-bats fly out of the gate, swinging with bad intentions."
"The challengers are showing a lot of heart, but the champs are really starting to find their rhythm now."
"Can the Ferrets hang in there with the best, especially when the best are, frankly, getting a little help from the refs?"
It's all down to this final round!
"Mako is leaving it all in the ring, but it looks like Tahno and Ming are up to more shenanigans!"
This has gone too far!
That water had rocks in it!
Knockout!
Come on!
Those were illegal headshots!
"Open your eyes, ref!"
"Well folks, it's a controversial call, but the Wolf-bats notch a nasty knockout to win the match!"
For the fourth year in a row they'll be crowned tournament champions!
I barely broke a sweat.
Anybody else wanna scrap with the champs?
Look out!
What?
"Folks, there is some sort of electrical disturbance in the stands."
Metalbender cops are dropping like bumble-flies!
There appear to be masked members of the audience wielding strange devices on their hands.
"One of them is in the booth with me right now, folks."
"He is leveling one of those glove devices at me now, and I believe he is about to electrocute me."
I am currently wetting my pants.
" What's going on here, ref?"
 I don't know!
"All right, you want a piece of the Wolf-bats?"
Here it comes!
"Wait! Please, don't do this!"
I'll give you the championship pot!
"I'll give you everything, just please don't take my bending!"
"I believe I have your attention, benders of Republic City."
"So, once again, the Wolf-bats are your Pro-bending champions."
It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory.
"Because every day, you threaten and abuse your fellow non-bending citizens, just like the Wolf-bats did to their opponents tonight."
Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world.
And yet it only took a few moments for me to cleanse them of their impurity.
Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there.
"If any of you stand in my way, you will meet the same fate."
"Now, to my followers..."
"For years, the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows."
"But now, we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City."
I'm happy to tell you that the time for change has finally come.
How are we gonna get out of here?
"Very soon, the current tyrannical bending regime..."
"Pabu! Listen up, buddy."
"Will be replaced by a fair-minded,"
Equalist government.
 You and your children...
 Stop fooling around!
"I'm not, I'm trying to save us!"
It's time to take back our city.
See?
Pabu's not just a one-trick poodle-pony.
"For centuries, benders have possessed an unnatural advantage over ordinary people."
"But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field."
Now anyone can hold the power of a Chi-blocker in their hand.
My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality.
"And once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world."
The Revolution has begun!
Tenzin!
"It's okay, Pabu, just a little explosion!"
"Keep chewing, you're almost through it!"
"Yes! Great job, buddy!"
 I'm going after Amon!
 Be careful!
You all right?
"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Don't mention it, kid."
Looks like we lost this one.
 I'm so glad you're okay.
" Me, too."
I can't believe Amon did this.
I played right into his hand.
He played us all.
Republic City is at war.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
"Although the Hundred Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace."
"These revolutionaries, who call themselves Equalists, are not interested in equality at all."
They just want to wage war against benders.
"Chief Beifong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop"
Amon's attack on the arena.
She has failed us all.
"If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership."
I still can't believe they're shutting this place down.
"Yeah, we had some good memories here, didn't we?"
"Guys, great news!"
You don't have to go back on the streets.
I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements.
You can come live on Air Temple Island with me.
"We'd love to, but..."
Asami already invited us to live in her dad's giant mansion!
"From here on out, it's gonna be the lap of luxury for us!"
"Hey, Korra!"
I was hoping you'd stop by.
I was just leaving.
"So, I guess I'll see you guys around..."
Sometime.
Why not tomorrow?
I'd love to have you come visit the estate.
I don't know.
I have some Avatar stuff to do.
"Come on, Korra!"
We all deserve a little rest and relaxation after all this craziness.
We can swim in Asami's pool.
It'll be fun.
"All right, Pabu."
"Great, we'll see you tomorrow."
Looks like our intel was good.
There's enough evidence here to bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.
This is an outrage!
I'm innocent!
"Yeah, yeah, that's what they all say."
Is it true that Cabbage Corp is conspiring with the Equalists?
"The evidence points in that direction, but the investigation is ongoing."
"For the time being, we have frozen Mr. Gan-Ian's assets and are closing Cabbage Corp."
No! Not my Cabbage Corp!
"Hey, Korra."
Tahno?
"Listen,"
"I know we're not exactly best friends, but I'm sorry Amon took your bending."
I've been to the best healers in the city.
"Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent."
You gotta get him for me.
"Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know."
I'm happy to help any way I can.
I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done.
We're ready for you now.
"See you around, Avatar."
Earthbending bomb!
Avatar Korra has arrived.
" Hey, Korra!"
 Glad you made it!
Welcome to paradise.
Looks like you guys settled right in.
Pretty much. Except someone forgot to ask her father if we could stay here.
"Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him."
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
This is the greatest place in the world!
"Watch this, watch this."
"Fetch me my towel, good sir!"
"Yes, Master Bolin."
"""Master Bolin."""
I love this guy!
"Now, pat me dry."
As you wish.
Don't forget Master Pabu.
"Wouldn't dream of it, sir."
"So, what do you have planned for us today?"
Let me guess. Shopping? Makeovers?
I vote makeovers!
I have something a little more exciting in mind.
"Pretty cool, huh?"
Way cooler than a makeover.
This is where Future Industries test drives their Sato-mobiles.
Ever been behind the wheel?
The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear-dog.
You want me to take you for a spin?
Let's do it.
Yeah!
That was amazing!
I didn't think we'd make it.
"Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes."
"I gotta admit, I had you pegged wrong."
I thought you were kind of prissy.
No offense.
It's all right.
People usually assume that
"I'm ""Daddy's helpless little girl,"" but I can handle myself."
"I mean, I've been in self-defense classes since I was this high."
My dad made sure
I would always be able to protect myself.
Smart guy.
Emergency! Emergency!
Coming through!
Is there another bathroom I can use?
We have a ladies' powder room upstairs.
First door on your right.
You can freshen up in there.
Thanks.
"No, no! I assure you, everything is going exactly as planned."
Yes.
"Luckily, the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time."
"Trust me, by the end of the week, we'll be ready to strike."
You're leaving?
 But I thought...
" Sorry, I forgot,"
I'm supposed to airsit...
I mean babybend...
I mean babysit the Airbender kids.
See you later!
"So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists, then framed Cabbage Corp?"
That's a bold accusation.
But what proof do you have?
"Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard."
Sato's up to something.
He does have the means.
And he has a motive.
That's right.
A motive? What is it?
"Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion."
A Firebender killed Sato's wife during the break-in.
That's terrible.
It was tragic.
It's possible he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.
Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.
What's going on?
Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?
I overheard him on the phone yesterday.
"Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists."
What? I don't believe this!
You spied on Hiroshi?
What's your problem?
"Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you..."
My father is innocent!
"Just because we're not benders, doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists!"
Equalists? Is that what this is about?
"I can assure you,"
I have nothing to do with those radicals.
"Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra."
I overheard you on the phone.
"You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike."
Explain that!
This is all just a misunderstanding resulting from the young Avatar's over active imagination.
My number one competitor was knocked out of the game.
"It's providing me an opportunity to ""strike"" the market with a new line of Sato-mobiles."
It's just business.
Nothing nefarious.
"In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?"
"If you feel it's necessary, you are welcome to search all of Future Industries."
Is it possible the presidents of
Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties?
"Or did Hiroshi Sato frame his longtime rival, Lau Gan-Ian?"
Or did Chief Beifong just plain arrest the wrong man?
So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato.
I can't believe we didn't find anything.
It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.
"Okay, you did your search."
Now you can all leave.
"So, I hope you're convinced now."
"No, I'm not."
I don't care how cooperative
"Hiroshi is being,"
I know he's lying.
Why are you doing this?
Are you that jealous of me and Asami?
What? Don't be ridiculous.
That has nothing to do with it.
"If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over."
I'm sorry.
Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.
I think you guys should hear this.
"""If you want to find the truth,"
"""meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."""
Over here.
"Listen, I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said."
I thought he could make life better for us non-benders.
But I didn't sign up for this... This war.
What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?
He manufactured those gloves for the Equalists.
I knew it!
And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger...
Some new kind of weapon.
We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.
That's because he has a secret factory.
Where?
It's right underneath the Sato mansion.
Raiding the Sato mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck.
 If we're wrong...
" I know, I can kiss my job goodbye."
But protecting Republic City is all I care about.
We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.
What are you doing here?
We have reason to believe there's a factory hidden below the mansion.
I think I would have noticed if there were a factory underneath my house.
The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father...
Where is your father?
"In his workshop, behind the house."
Dad?
Hello?
"Chief, the estate has been secured."
No one's left the workshop since we arrived.
Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving.
"There's a tunnel beneath the workshop, running deep into the mountainside."
What? There's no tunnel.
Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?
I don't understand.
There must be an explanation.
Maybe you don't know everything about your father.
I'm sorry.
"Officers, into the tunnel."
Be cautious.
You three stay up here.
"Officer Song, keep an eye on them."
Not your average backyard workshop.
And I'm guessing those are the new weapons.
"Hiroshi was lying, all right."
But where is he?
What was that?
We need to get down there and see what's going on.
Absolutely not.
You're staying put until the Chief comes back.
"All right, we'll stay put."
But can we wait outside or something?
It's so dusty in this workshop.
No. We're waiting right here.
"Okay, but don't blame me if I start snee..."
If I start snee...
"What's your problem, bub?"
I'm about to...
"Sorry, pal."
We know you were just doing your job.
"Yeah, just stay put until the Chief comes back."
"That sounds very familiar, doesn't it?"
Why? Because you said it.
"Asami, you should stay here."
We'll check it out.
I have to find out the truth about my father.
I understand.
That's why I'm going down to find out for you.
Please.
All right.
Be careful.
"I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Beifong."
It's solid platinum.
My mecha-tanks are platinum as well.
Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.
"Hiroshi, I knew you were a lying, no-good Equalist!"
Come out here and...
"And do what, young Avatar?"
Face the wrath of your bending?
"No, I think I'll fight from inside here where my odds are a little more..."
Equal.
That source was a setup.
You lured us down here!
Guilty as charged.
Korra!
"Well, I'd say that was a near-flawless test run."
Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon.
No.
Korra was right.
"We gotta do something, quick!"
"Not so fast, boys."
"Hello, Mr. Sato."
"Wow, what a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion."
"Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar..."
It was all just a big cover.
"Yes, and the most difficult part was watching my daughter traipse around with a firebending street rat like you."
"Dad, stop!"
Why?
"Sweetie,"
"I wanted to keep you out of this for as long as I could, but now that you know the truth, please forgive me."
These people...
These benders...
"They took away your mother, the love of my life."
They've ruined the world!
"But with Amon, we can fix it and build a perfect world together."
"We can help people like us, everywhere!"
"Join me, Asami."
No.
"I love you, Dad."
Let's get out of here!
"My Metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault."
"Tarrlok's right, I failed as chief."
"First thing in the morning,"
I'm handing in my resignation.
No! You can't give up like this.
I'm not giving up.
I'm going to find my officers and take Amon down.
"But I'm going to do it my way, outside the law."
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
But Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe.
 Even now.
 I know.
I'm sorry this whole thing happened.
"So, does your offer to live at the Air Temple still stand?"
Of course it does.
"And Asami's welcome, too."
Thank you so much.
"After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako."
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Republic City is at war!
"After discovering that her father,"
"Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy,"
Asami turns against him.
"And following another defeat at the hands of the Equalists,"
Lin Beifong resigns as chief of police.
"With the Equalist army growing stronger, who will help the Avatar stop Amon and restore balance to the city?"
You're finally here!
"Welcome to Air Temple Island, your new home."
Yes! Welcome to my domain!
"Well, aren't you sweet, little monk child?"
What's that fuzzy creature?
"That is a fire ferret, an arboreal mammal common to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom."
He's cute!
"Yip yip. Fly, sky bison. Fly!"
Thanks for sending the Air Acolytes to help us with the move.
"Yes, they've been amazing."
Such tireless workers.
I thought you were only bringing a few things.
"Trust me, it could've been worse."
No problem. Everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.
You're pretty.
Can I have some of your hair?
Looks like I have some competition.
And now for the grand tour!
"The flying bison sleep in those caves down there, and that's the temple"
"Grandpa Aang built, and that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat."
I have a couple questions.
Is this an all-vegetarian island?
Is that where you train airbending?
Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes?
Do we each get our own sky bison?
"And final question, how many trees are on this island?"
"Yes, yes, no, no, 10,552."
"So, where are we going to be staying?"
You're a boy.
Boys have to stay on the boys' side.
I'd be happy to show you to the men's dormitory!
I'm a boy!
"Meelo, why don't you go with the boys, too?"
"We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman."
"Ikki and I will take you to your room, this way."
"Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako?"
"No, I wasn't completely aware of that."
 Hey!
" Run along, Ikki!"
So...
Here's your room.
I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to.
I think it's really charming.
And the best part about it?
Nothing here reminds me of my father.
Thank you for your hospitality.
"Ikki, I swear, if you don't leave us alone,"
I'm gonna...
Tenzin! Come right in!
"Good day, ladies."
"Asami, welcome to the island."
Thank you for having me.
"Beifong's replacement, Saikhan, is going to be inducted as the new chief of police later."
I think we should both be there.
It was an honor serving under
"Chief Beifong for so many years, and I wish her a speedy recovery."
It is with great humility that I take her place as the new chief of police.
Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen.
"But there is one man who has been effective against Amon's revolution,"
Councilman Tarrlok.
"That is why, for all matters involving the Equalists,"
I will report directly to him.
"The police department will lend any and all available resources to the Councilman and his task force, until we quell this insurgency."
What is that weasel-snake
Tarrlok up to now?
"Tarrlok, I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket, but I highly doubt it was legal."
"Tenzin, always the conspiracy theorist."
Did you ever consider
Saikhan simply recognizes my talents and wants what is best for this city?
"Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see."
"Now that your little Pro-bending distractions are over,"
I look forward to your return to my task force.
Forget it. There's no way
I'm rejoining your vanity project.
That is unfortunate to hear.
"But I am sure you will come to your senses, as you have in the past."
"Don't hold your breath, bub."
"You know,"
Tenzin's been right about you all along.
"You played me, you played Beifong, and now you're playing the new Chief, too."
"Well, I got news for you."
"You need me, but I don't need you."
I'm the Avatar.
"You are not, in fact, the Avatar."
You are merely a half-baked Avatar-in-training.
"Which reminds me, how is your airbending going?"
Made any significant progress with that?
I didn't think so.
"If you will not be part of my task force, then you had best stay out of my way."
I don't understand what's wrong with me.
"I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms, but I still can't produce a single, measly puff of air!"
I'm a failure.
"No, you're not."
You just need to work through this airbending block.
Amazing advice. I'll get right on that.
I wasn't finished yet.
"You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance."
Have you ever made contact with your past lives?
"No, of course I haven't."
Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus?
"I'm a spiritual failure, too."
You may have made a connection without realizing it.
Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?
Maybe.
"I had a few weird hallucinations, but I hardly even remember them."
And did you see any of the previous
Avatars in these visions?
I saw Aang.
It seemed like he was in trouble.
What do you think it means?
"I don't know, but I urge you to meditate on these visions."
I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.
Korra! You out here?
Korra!
There you are.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
"Come on, what's wrong?"
You can tell us.
How am I supposed to save the city when I can't even learn airbending?
I'm the worst Avatar ever.
I just feel alone.
"No, that's nonsense. You're amazing!"
"Yeah, and remember,"
Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation.
He was just a little kid!
"And he wasn't alone, he had his friends to help him."
"Look, the arena might be shut down, but we're still a team."
The new Team Avatar!
"We've got your back, Korra."
And we can save the city together.
"Yeah, let's do it!"
What are we doing?
"Get ready, Republic City."
You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.
"Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits."
I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon.
"All right, let's ride."
"Naga, away!"
"All right, scratch that. Any other ideas?"
I think I have the answer.
You think this'll do?
I like the new Team Avatar's style.
"Unit 216, cancel that 10-58 at Harmony Tower."
"Come back to the station, over."
My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars.
I guess now I know why.
"Calling all units, level four alert."
Jailbreak at headquarters.
"Officers down, electrocuted."
"Chi-blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large, armed and dangerous."
Last seen heading east.
"I repeat, level four alert,"
Equalist jailbreak.
Chi-blockers! That's them!
Let's get 'em!
"Korra, Bolin, give me a ramp, now!"
Help me out! We gotta make this turn!
They don't know we made the turn.
"Okay, get ready."
"Avatar Korra, what do you think you're doing?"
"Hey, Tarrlok."
Nice of you to show up finally.
"Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you."
What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.
"That's funny,"
I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time.
"If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would've gotten away."
"This is your last warning, stay out of my way."
Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom.
But the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down.
The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists or even be associated with them.
"It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all non-benders are in their own homes by nightfall."
"This is going too far, Tarrlok."
You can't punish all non-benders for the actions of a few.
That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands.
We must pass this law.
All in favor?
"All available units, please respond to the 5600 block of Dragon Flats Borough."
Equalists have taken to the streets.
Consider them armed and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.
I call front.
After you.
What a gentleman. Thanks.
Why is the power out?
"Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous."
Sure doesn't look that way.
"All non-benders, return to your homes immediately!"
"Yeah, as soon as you turn our power back on!"
Disperse or you will all be arrested!
You benders can't treat us this way!
"Mommy, look, it's the Avatar."
"Please, help us."
"You're our Avatar, too."
"Everyone, please stay calm."
I'm gonna put a stop to this.
"Tarrlok, you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone."
"Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here."
We're not going anywhere.
You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals.
This is an Equalist rally.
There is nothing innocent about it.
They're not Equalists.
They're just normal people who want their rights back.
They are the enemy.
Round up all these Equalists!
Stop!
Hey! Let me go!
You're under arrest.
What? You can't do that!
"Actually, I can."
"She's a non-bender out past curfew, and her father is a known Equalist conspirator."
Let her go!
Arrest him and his brother.
Tarrlok!
"Unless you want to join your friends in prison,"
I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple.
"Korra, listen to him. It's not worth it."
We'll be all right.
"Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin."
He can get you out!
So sad to see your little
Team Avatar broken up.
You had a good run.
"This isn't over, Tarrlok!"
I believe it is.
Take them away.
 Hey!
 I came as fast as I could.
Are your friends all right?
"I don't know, these knuckleheads won't tell me anything."
I'll take care of this.
"Saikhan, a word, please."
"Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait?"
"No, it cannot."
Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight.
I'd like you to release them immediately.
They're not going anywhere.
They were interfering with police business.
Your so-called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists.
"They should be released, too!"
All Equalist suspects are being detained indefinitely.
They'll be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.
Those people are entitled to due process under the law.
You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.
"I plan to at the Council meeting, first thing in the morning."
You're officially the worst chief of police ever!
"Calm down, Korra."
I'll get this sorted out.
We just need to be patient.
But you really are the worst. Ever.
"Wake up, Naga. Let's go."
"Wait for me here, girl."
"Don't worry, I'll be all right."
You and I need to talk.
Are any of the other
Council members here?
I believe everyone has gone home for the night.
Then you should do the same.
"Are you sure, sir?"
Leave us.
You obviously have something on your mind.
Spit it out.
Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders.
You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people.
And you don't?
Of... Of course not!
Isn't that what you came here to do?
Intimidate me into releasing your friends?
"See, that's what"
"I admire about you, Korra, your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want."
It is a quality we both share.
You and I are nothing alike.
"Look, I'll make you a deal."
"You fall in line and do what I say, and I'll release your friends."
That's why you arrested them?
To get to me?
I need your answer.
No.
You might be able to manipulate
"Chief Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me."
You will regret that decision.
You need to be stopped!
You're just as bad as Amon.
"I've tried to work with you, Korra, but you've made it impossible."
Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar?
What are you gonna do now?
"You're all out of water, pal."
"You're in my way, Avatar, and you need to be removed."
You're a...
You're a Bloodbender?
Very observant.
It's not a full moon. How...
How are you doing this?
There are a lot of things you don't know about me.
Where are you taking me?
Somewhere no one will find you.
"Say goodbye to Republic City,"
Avatar Korra.
You'll never see it again.
You can't do this!
Let me out!
No!
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
The Avatar has been abducted!
"After Tarrlok arrested her friends,"
Korra confronted the councilman in his chambers.
But the heated argument quickly turned into an all-out bending battle.
"Desperate to save himself,"
Tarrlok revealed his ability to bloodbend and took Korra far from Republic City.
Will the Avatar's friends find her before it's too late?
What are you doing?
Tarrlok!
You can't keep me in here forever!
"Who is this? It's 6:00 in the morning, this better be important."
Councilman Tenzin here.
What?
What happened?
What was Korra doing at City Hall?
"As I told Chief Saikhan,"
Korra came to my office late last night.
She was upset that I arrested her friends.
"She asked me to release them, and that's when the Equalists attacked."
"I tried to protect Korra, but we were outnumbered."
"Then, I was electrocuted."
"When I came to, the police had arrived, but Korra was gone."
I'm so sorry.
"Chief Saikhan, mobilize the entire police force."
We have to find the Avatar.
We interrupt your regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you this special report.
"Late last night,"
"Equalists attacked City Hall, subduing Councilman Tarrlok and capturing Avatar Korra."
"Details are still coming in, but..."
Hope you got enough beauty rest.
"Come on, I'm busting you out."
"Thanks, I owe you."
Are you done yet?
Cover your ears.
I can't go with you listening!
Asami!
"A little privacy, please!"
Are you all right?
I'm fine. It's so good to see you.
"Hate to break up your lovers' reunion, but Korra's in trouble."
Amon captured her.
"No. No, she can't be gone."
"Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue."
Your fly was down.
Thanks for catching that.
Somebody! Help! Please!
Please...
I urge you to meditate on these visions.
I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.
"What are you doing here, Aang?"
"I told you, I have this under control."
"Under normal circumstances,"
I wouldn't get involved.
"But if what those victims said is true, we're not dealing with a normal criminal."
"Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes."
"Toph, I'm 40 years old, you think you could stop with the nicknames?"
Afraid not.
"It's over. You're under arrest, Yakone."
What is Republic City coming to?
"Used to be, a man could enjoy his lunch in peace."
What's the big idea?
"We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone."
We know what you are.
Take him away.
"I've beaten every trumped-up charge you yahoos have brought against me, and I'll beat this one, too!"
"I finally connected with you, Aang."
But what are you trying to tell me?
A way out of this box would be nice.
I have to go.
Call me back the minute you hear anything.
"Lin, what are you..."
You should be in the hospital!
"And you three, you should be in prison!"
I figured you could use our help finding Korra.
Do you have any leads?
"I've been on the phone all morning, but, nothing yet."
We need Naga. She can track Korra.
I'm afraid her polar bear-dog is missing as well.
Then where do we start?
My guess is the Equalists are hiding underground in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.
"Underground, just like my father's secret factory."
Figures.
"Yeah, yeah, that makes sense."
"When those Chi-blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel."
I know where to start looking. Come on!
"Wherever Amon is keeping Korra,"
"I bet that's where my officers are, too."
"Let's bring them all home, Lin."
The truck with Bolin took off down this alley.
Which way?
This way kind of smells familiar.
There's a tunnel nearby.
There!
Motorcycle tracks.
Korra has to be in there...
Somewhere.
Let's try this way.
And what if Korra's not down there?
Then we pick another tunnel until we find her.
"Hey, is Mako all right?"
He seems really worried about Korra.
"Yeah, we all are."
"I know, but he's your brother."
Do you think he likes Korra as more than just a friend?
"What? No. That's just gossip, where'd you hear that?"
Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now.
"What do you know, Bolin?"
"Come on, spill it."
Nothing! I mean...
"There was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but..."
They kissed?
"Believe me, I was upset, too, but I'm over it."
I don't think it meant anything.
I doubt that.
Hide!
That tram goes to the training camp.
"Everything was delivered to the prison, sir."
That's where they must be keeping Korra.
We need to get down that tunnel.
 It's empty.
" Yeah, I can see that."
You two keep an eye on them.
My officers are inside.
What about Korra?
I don't see her yet.
"Avatar Korra, where are you keeping her?"
Chief Beifong?
I'm too late.
"That monster already took your bending, didn't he?"
I'm so sorry.
"Come on, let's get you out of here."
I'll ask you one more time.
Where is she?
We don't have the Avatar.
And the Equalists didn't attack City Hall.
 Tarrlok's lying.
 What?
I scanned the entire prison.
Korra's not here.
Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?
Because he has Korra. He fooled us all.
"Let's go, people!"
"Try to Chi-block that, fools!"
We got more company!
Hang on!
Yakone has ruled Republic City's criminal empire for years.
"Yet he has always managed to stay out of the law's reach, until now."
You will hear testimony from dozens of his victims.
And they will tell you
"Yakone has maintained his grip on the underworld by using an ability that has been illegal for decades, bloodbending."
"The prosecution's entire case is built upon the make-believe notion that my client is able to bloodbend at will, at any time, on any day."
"I remind the Council that bloodbending is an incredibly rare skill, and it can only be performed during a full moon."
"Yet the witnesses will claim that my client used bloodbending at every other time, except during a full moon."
It would be a mockery of justice to convict a man of a crime that is impossible to commit.
Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict.
"In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities."
I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind.
"Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history, until our esteemed Chief of Police,"
"Toph Beifong, single-handedly developed the skill."
The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this Council that Yakone is one of these unique benders.
And he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes.
We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison.
Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.
 Chief.
 Lin.
Have you news of Avatar Korra?
"We do. You kidnapped her, Tarrlok."
I am shocked you would accuse me of such an evil act.
"I already explained,"
Equalists attacked us and took her!
But there were no Chi-blockers here last night.
"You planted the evidence, didn't you?"
That is a ridiculous accusation!
It's true! He took her!
"I was here when Avatar Korra arrived last night, but Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave."
I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok bring her down to the garage...
"Say goodbye to Republic City,"
Avatar Korra.
You'll never see it again.
That is nonsense!
Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!
Why did you wait until now to fess up?
I was terrified to tell because...
Because Tarrlok is a Bloodbender!
He bloodbent Avatar Korra!
Don't make this worse for yourself.
Tell us where you have Korra.
Wake up.
"Man, I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil Bloodbender."
So weird.
"Bolin, that really happened."
He knocked us out.
Are you serious? Where is he?
Is he here right now?
Tarrlok is long gone.
I'll alert the whole force.
We've only been out for a little while.
Maybe we can still pick up
Tarrlok's trail.
It could lead us to Korra. Let's go.
"Yakone, you won't get away with this!"
"Republic City is mine, Avatar."
I'll be back one day to claim it.
"This time, I'm gonna put you to sleep for good!"
"I'm taking away your bending, for good."
It's over.
"Aang, this whole time, you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok."
"My life is a disaster now, thanks to you!"
So your little bloodbending secret's out?
And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon.
You're Yakone's son!
I was his son.
"But in order to win Republic City,"
I had to become someone else.
My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly.
My plan was perfect.
I was to be the city's savior.
But you... You ruined everything!
"Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go."
"No. No, I'll escape and start a new life."
And you're coming as my hostage.
You'll never get away with this!
Amon!
It is time for you to be equalized.
You fool. You've never faced bending like mine!
What... What are you?
I am the solution.
I'll take care of him.
You four retrieve the Avatar.
Do not underestimate her.
Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it.
My pleasure.
It's payback time.
Open the box.
Tie her up.
I thought I told you not to underestimate her.
"Naga, you came looking for me."
Good girl.
That sounds like Naga!
Down there!
Korra!
Thank goodness!
Where's Tarrlok?
How did you get away?
Give her some space.
I was so worried. Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm glad you're here.
You're safe now.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Amon's revolution grows stronger by the day!
"First, he attacked the bending arena!"
Then it was discovered that
Hiroshi Sato was the mastermind behind the Equalist gloves and mecha-tanks!
"And most recently,"
"Amon ambushed Councilman Tarrlok, took his bending, and nearly captured the Avatar, as well!"
"Everyone is on edge, wondering where will Amon strike next?"
"Daddy, you're home."
We waited up for you. ls Korra okay?
"Yes, she's fine, sweetie."
I was scared.
I thought she wasn't coming back.
I'm sorry you were scared.
But everything is going to be fine now.
I promise.
"The food tastes amazing, Pema."
I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.
We're so thankful you're home safe.
Let me help.
"Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened."
"Well, first off,"
Tarrlok isn't who he says he is.
He's Yakone's son.
It all makes sense now.
That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a full moon.
But how did you escape?
And where's Tarrlok?
Amon captured him and took his bending.
What?
"Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere."
"He almost got me, too."
This is very disturbing news.
Amon is becoming emboldened.
"Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar..."
I fear Amon is entering his endgame.
"Pema, are you all right?"
"The baby is just kicking really hard, is all."
 I'm fine.
 Should I get Tenzin?
No reason to worry him. It's nothing.
Can I get some hot water?
Korra needs more tea.
You're a Firebender. Boil it yourself.
"I'm going to step out, in case you two want to talk."
Is there something we need to talk about?
"I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing."
"You have feelings for her, don't you?"
What? No.
She was taken by a crazy Bloodbender!
How did you expect me to act?
I like Korra.
But you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.
The truth? About what?
You're really going to make me say it?
"Yes, because I don't know what you're talking about."
"The kiss, Mako. I know."
I... Well...
"Bolin told you, didn't he?"
Don't blame your brother for what you did.
"Do you have feelings for Korra, or not?"
"Look, things are crazy right now."
Can we deal with our relationship problems later?
"Well, there might not be any relationship to worry about later."
Asami...
"Lin, I need to ask you a favor."
"It would mean the world to me, but I know it could be a potentially awkward situation. Furthermore..."
Spit it out already!
Will you stay here and watch over Pema and the children while I meet with the Council?
"With everything that's happened lately,"
I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.
"Of course I'll help, old friend."
I didn't realize you two were out here.
"Pema! Yes, yes..."
Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.
Thank you.
I could use the extra pair of hands.
Would you mind giving him a bath?
He's filthy.
This is not what I signed on for!
"Thank you, Lin!"
"Oogi, yip yip!"
I gotta poo! Really bad!
Do you know where my keys are?
I can't find them anywhere.
"No, dear."
 Found them!
" Good, dear."
"Don't wait up for me, this Council session will probably go late into the night."
"The door, dear."
We're here to fix a spider-rat problem.
I didn't call an exterminator.
Dear?
I'm so relieved to see you!
"The other Council members, are they all right?"
I'm afraid not.
I just received a call from Chief Saikhan.
They've all been captured!
This can't be happening.
The leadership of Republic City is in your hands now.
"It is a tragic day, indeed!"
"All right, kids, time to go inside."
We heard explosions. What's going on?
Republic City is under attack.
I've dreamed of this day for so long.
Yes. The time has come for the Equalists to claim Republic City as their own.
Where did you say you parked the car?
It's right around here somewhere.
There it is!
Nice parking job.
"Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car."
I made it very clear I don't know how to drive.
"All things considered, you did a great job."
But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets?
"Relax, the city's under attack."
The police have more important things to worry about.
This'll come in handy.
Why don't you sit in back? With Korra.
I think I will.
Everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's terrific.
Car! We're good.
"Chief, Air Unit Seven was just taken out by an Equalist airship!"
They've crashed into the harbor!
Send a River Rescue Unit.
"Chief, all River Rescue ships have been sabotaged!"
What?
Chief Saikhan.
Tenzin! Am I glad to see you.
"I was afraid you'd been captured, too."
I'm the only Council member left.
What's the status?
Amon has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs.
"The police are trying to regain control, but we're spread too thin."
I need to send a wire.
"To whom, Councilman?"
The General of the United Forces.
"Councilman, your wire has been sent."
"Chief, the phone lines just went dead!"
Catch.
"Saikhan, the vents!"
We need to evacuate immediately.
Everyone stay close to me!
Not these mecha-tanks again!
Saikhan. No.
Jump!
Thank you.
Tenzin has escaped once again.
I can't stand to see Asami fighting alongside those benders.
"We will capture them before long, and you will have your daughter back."
Are you all right?
"I'm fine. Thank you, kids."
Another moment later and I would've been on my way to Amon.
"Guys, look."
No.
"Everyone, hide inside and remain calm."
"Pull it together, Pema!"
Didn't I just say remain calm?
"Mommy, what's wrong?"
The baby's coming!
 No.
" Not now, baby!"
"The children, where are they?"
"Don't worry, they're in the other room, totally safe."
Stay away from my dad's ex-girlfriend!
"Jinora, you shouldn't be out here!"
Get off our island!
"Girls, you need to go back inside this instant!"
Taste my fury!
"Meelo, be careful!"
Never mind.
Take these Equalists and lock them in the temple's basement.
"Nice work, kids."
Dad!
Thank goodness you're all right!
We caught the bad guys!
You let them fight?
Do you realize what could have happened?
I would've been toast if it weren't for your kids.
You should be proud.
You taught them well.
"Go on, be with your wife."
Pema!
Tenzin.
"I'm here, Pema."
Our new son.
Hello.
Come meet your new brother!
"A brother? Well, it's about time!"
Welcome! I'm Ikki and this is Jinora and Meelo.
"We have a super great family, and we're so happy that you're a part of it."
What are you going to name him?
Can I pick?
We already chose a name.
Rohan.
"I'm so sorry to interrupt, but..."
More airships are coming.
"Everything's not going to be fine, is it, Daddy?"
"What do you want to do, Tenzin?"
I need to protect my family and get them as far away from this conflict as possible.
If Amon got his hands on my children...
I hate to even think of it.
"If you're leaving, then I'm going with you."
 But...
 No arguments.
You and your family are the last Airbenders.
There's no way in the world
I'm letting Amon take your bending away.
"Thank you, Lin."
"Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being."
I'm not giving up.
I'm not asking you to.
I've sent word to the United Forces.
They will be here soon.
"And once my family is safe, I will return."
"With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war."
"What you're saying is, we need to be patient."
You're learning well.
" Stay safe, Korra."
" You, too."
"Tenzin, if we're leaving, we better do it now!"
"Oogi, yip yip."
Go! We'll hold them off.
"Everyone, climb on!"
"Let's go, girl!"
Mustache guy!
"Nice one, Naga!"
 They're gaining on us!
" Faster, Oogi!"
"Whatever happens to me, don't turn back."
"Lin, what are you doing?"
That lady is my hero!
"Yes, she is."
"Korra, we should get moving."
"Tell me where the Avatar is, and I'll let you keep your bending."
"I won't tell you anything, you monster!"
Very well.
"General, I just received a wire from the Avatar."
She says Amon and his forces have gained control of the city.
How do you want to respond?
Tell her we will be arriving in three days' time.
And that I look forward to winning back
"Republic City, together."
"As you wish, General Iroh."
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
The Equalists are on the attack.
The Lieutenant and his Chi-blockers invaded Air Temple Island and forced Tenzin and his family to flee.
"In the daring escape,"
Lin Beifong sacrificed herself and saved the Airbenders.
"But she was captured, and Amon took her bending away."
"Now, Team Avatar is in hiding, as they await help from"
General Iroh and the United Forces.
"It is a glorious day, my Equalist brothers and sisters."
Amon has torn down the tyrannical bending government.
He has declared bending illegal.
And he has the Avatar on the run.
Our great leader has a vision for the future.
"One day soon, bending will no longer exist, and we will live in a world where everyone is finally equal."
The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream.
But we will prevail!
Can you believe Hiroshi?
"""The Avatar's on the run."""
I'm not running from anyone.
Let's go back up there and knock some heads.
 They'll never know what hit 'em.
 Relax.
General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships.
Then Amon will be the one who's running.
"I hate this ""being patient"" stuff."
You two were gone awhile.
We were doing reconnaissance.
Whatever.
Welcome back.
"Hope you worked up an appetite,"
'cause dinner is served.
Thanks so much for letting us hide out with you the past few days.
Honored to oblige.
My associates and I heartily oppose
Amon's so-called Equalist policies.
We got benders and non-benders livin' together down here.
"But do you see us fightin'? No, siree."
We figured out how to harmoniously coexist.
You are a wise and noble hobo.
This is the best tasting street gruel
I've ever had. Seriously.
I culled it from the finest dumpsters the city has to offer.
Can't sleep either?
No. I have this awful pit in my stomach.
"Me, too."
"It's so crazy. A few months ago,"
"I was in the South Pole, practicing for my firebending test, and now I'm in the middle of an all-out war."
I know.
We didn't even know each other then.
"And now,"
I can't imagine my life without you in it.
"You're the most loyal, brave and selfless person I've ever known."
"I think you're pretty incredible, too, but you already knew that."
I should probably try to get some sleep.
"Me, too. Good night."
Good night.
You will now be cleansed of your impurity.
Next.
Coast is clear.
"Once the United Forces arrive, we need to be ready to help in any way we can."
They're here.
Amon had to know we were coming.
So why aren't we meeting any resistance?
Wait a second.
Where are the Equalist airships?
"I don't see any mecha-tanks, either."
Something's not right.
It's a trick.
"Water and Earthbenders, detonate those mines."
What is that sound?
What now?
"Where does Hiroshi find the time to keep inventing new, evil machines?"
Incoming!
It's all right. I've got you.
Avatar Korra?
You saved my life. Thank you.
I was prepared to deal with
"Sato's mecha-tanks,"
" but not these new, high-speed aircraft."
 I know.
"Every time we think we have an advantage, Amon outsmarts us."
"No matter what our plan is, he always has a better one."
"Amon is winning so far, but we're not out of the fight yet."
I like this man's confidence.
"So, how are we not out of the fight?"
"A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them."
Do you still have a way to get a message out?
I know just the man for the job.
And who is the recipient of this top secret message?
"Commander Bumi, second division of the United Forces."
 Tenzin's brother?
 Yes.
"Bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet."
"Ready, sir."
Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft.
Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal.
Do not approach city until you receive the all-clear.
Now comes the hard part.
We need to ground those aircraft.
"Otherwise, Bumi's fleet will never be able to retake the city."
They flew in from this direction.
The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range.
Everyone get ready. We leave at dawn.
It's time to take down my father.
Wait.
"I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow."
 What?
 Why not?
I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon.
It's time I face him.
That's not a good plan.
We need to stick together.
I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down.
My gut's telling me it's time to end this on my terms.
"Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone."
She won't be. I'm going with you.
 You don't have to do that.
 Yes. I do.
My grandfather would respect the Avatar's instinct.
So will I.
"Love you, little bro."
"Love you back, big bro."
"Korra, Amon is a nasty dude. Be careful."
I will. Good luck.
"If you're going into the mountains, you should bring Naga."
Take good care of Bolin for me.
Asami.
I'm sorry things got so messed up between us.
"But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you."
"I care about you, too."
"Good fortune and success to you, valiant heroes."
There's Amon.
We need to get into the temple.
"Then, when he returns..."
We ambush him.
What are you two doing here?
We were just transferred.
"Well, you're getting transferred again."
Amon wants extra security at the arena today.
 The arena? For what?
 The rally.
You should have been briefed about this.
"We'll be there, sir."
I know another way in.
Let's hide in the attic.
We're not alone up here.
Tarrlok?
I don't suppose you're here to rescue me.
We had no idea you were here.
Are there other prisoners on the island?
No. I'm the only one.
And what makes you so special?
I'm Amon's brother.
Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.
"He is a Waterbender and a Bloodbender, just like I was."
What?
Did you know this all along?
No. Not until after he captured me.
How did your brother end up becoming Amon?
"It all began with my father, Yakone."
"With the help of his former gang, he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance."
He assumed a new identity and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe.
"That's where he met my mother, a warm, caring woman."
"Before long, they started a family together."
"Amon was the firstborn, under the name Noatak."
I was born three years later.
"Noatak was a good-natured kid, always looking out for me."
"Those were the good years, before my brother and I discovered we were Waterbenders."
"At first, we were excited by our new abilities, but our training brought out a different side of my father."
"Tarrlok, you better shape up, or you'll be out here in the cold all night, until you get it right."
" I'm trying, but..."
 Try harder.
Your brother was never this sloppy.
"Dad, he'll get it. He just needs time."
"Don't talk back to me, son. Ever."
"Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally."
"When I was seven, my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip, far away from our home."
"He told us his true identity was Yakone,"
"Republic City's most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a Bloodbender of rare skill."
What's bloodbending?
The most powerful and feared form of bending in the world.
"It was declared illegal, thanks to that coward, Katara."
Our family has the strongest line of Bloodbenders in history.
You boys have this power inside of you.
And I will teach you to master it.
"What happened to your bending, Dad?"
The Avatar stole it from me.
"That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny."
You two will become
Bloodbenders of the highest order.
"When the time is right, you will claim Republic City, and you will destroy the Avatar."
You must avenge me.
That is your purpose in life.
The good days were behind us.
"Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed hunting trip, where he secretly trained us in bloodbending."
We kept the truth from our mother.
Stop. You're hurting it.
"Toughen up, Tarrlok."
You'll need a thicker skin for this.
"Very good, son. Very good."
"A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon."
"We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it."
I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals.
"My brother, however, seemed to revel in his newfound power."
"He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was 14."
That's the way it's done.
That's what you need to strive for.
"Even though Noatak was my father's favorite, it wasn't any easier for him."
He carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and demands.
Something changed in Noatak over the years.
The loving brother I once knew became cold and detached.
"Our father pushed us to extremes, and one day, he made us bloodbend each other."
Noatak. Go.
Excellent.
Tarrlok. Your turn.
No.
I won't do it.
"Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok."
That felt awful.
I don't want to do that to anyone.
I never want to bloodbend again.
"You're a disgrace, a weakling."
"I'll teach you a lesson, you insubordinate..."
Stay away from him.
How dare you bloodbend me!
What are you going to do about it?
You're the weak one.
"You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world, but it isn't. The Avatar is."
He took your bending away.
What could be more powerful than that?
I made you what you are.
You're mine.
"We're your sons, not your tools of revenge."
Let's go.
We can run away from him. Forever.
Run away? But what about Mom?
We can't just leave her.
He was right about you.
You are a weakling.
"Noatak! Don't leave, please!"
Noatak!
"My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak."
We thought he perished in that storm.
My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother.
My father stopped training me.
"With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered, and he passed away a few years later."
That's one of the saddest stories
I've ever heard.
"Avatar Korra,"
I am truly sorry for all that I did to you.
"I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me."
"I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be."
And so did my brother.
"The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world."
How did you figure out
Amon is your brother?
"When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar."
I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip.
So he somehow uses bloodbending to take people's bending?
"I don't know how he does it, but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak."
 How in the world do we beat him?
 We can't.
"Any attack we throw at him, he'll redirect with his mind."
That's how he's been able to challenge any bender.
So much for our ambush.
"If we stay here, we're toast."
 But there's another way to beat him.
 How?
"This whole time,"
Amon has been one step ahead of us.
But finally we have the advantage.
We know the truth about him.
If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters...
At the rally.
We could take away his true power.
And undermine this whole revolution.
Thank you for your help.
 We can't just leave him here.
 Go.
Amon can't know anyone spoke with me.
Defeat him. Put an end to this sad story.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Korra and Mako have discovered the truth about Amon's identity.
"He's a Waterbender, a Bloodbender and brother to Tarrlok."
"Now, Korra and Mako plan to infiltrate the Equalist victory rally and expose Amon as a fraud."
"Meanwhile,"
"Asami, Bolin and General Iroh head towards Hiroshi's secret airfield, where Asami intends to take down her father."
I think we found our secret airfield.
"Bolin, once we get down there,"
I need you to tear up those runways.
 We can't let those aircraft take off.
" Aye-aye, Captain."
General. General.
"All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay?"
Stay.
Why would there be fence posts but no fence?
Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion.
"When I was a boy, a Firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred."
That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.
"That's a lie, Amon."
Or should I call you Noatak?
 You want her taken out?
 No.
"Everyone, calm down."
We have nothing to fear from the Avatar.
Let's hear what she has to say.
Amon has been lying to you.
The Spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away.
He uses bloodbending to do it.
Amon is a Waterbender.
What is this nonsense?
"You're desperate, Avatar."
Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort.
Your family wasn't killed by a Firebender.
"His father was Yakone, and his brother is Councilman Tarrlok."
An amusing tale.
But I will show you the truth.
This is what a Firebender did to me.
What?
The Avatar is lying.
"I'm telling you, he's a Waterbender."
They don't believe me. It didn't work.
We said what we had to.
Let's get out of here.
"I wouldn't leave yet, Avatar."
You'll miss the main event.
No. They got away.
We saw them get away.
Asami.
"Asami, I know I have hurt you, and I am sorry."
"But I believe that one day, you will come to your senses and we can be a family again."
Are you insane?
How can we be a family after everything you've done?
Mom would hate you for what you've become.
How dare you! I am avenging her death!
" The airplanes are ready for takeoff, sir."
 Good. Annihilate the fleet.
"That's right, General."
I intercepted your message to Commander Bumi.
I know exactly where they're hiding.
How are we going to get out of here?
I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?
"That is a negative, sir."
"Naga, over here."
Who needs a Metalbender?
We got Naga. Yeah!
 I'm going after those airplanes.
" No! No, Naga!"
What do you know?
Just like a Future Industries forklift.
"Tonight, I rid the world of airbending."
Forever.
"Amon, let them go."
You're welcome to come down here and try to stop me.
 He's trying to bait you.
 I don't care. We have to save them.
The Avatar needs to be reminded of the power I possess.
 Where are Pema and the baby?
 In prison.
 Beifong?
 I don't know.
"Follow me, kids."
Get them out of here.
We'll create a diversion.
 Let's go get your mother and the baby.
 Prison break!
Let her go!
No!
Korra!
I told you I would destroy you.
"Thanks for looking out for me, Aang."
"Thanks, Naga."
Asami.
What do you think you're doing?
You are aiding the very people who took your mother away.
You don't feel love for Mom anymore.
You're too full of hatred.
"You ungrateful, insolent child!"
I now see there is no chance to save you.
"Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father."
You really are a horrible father.
"Finally, you are powerless."
Amon.
"Everything the Avatar said is true, isn't it?"
I just saw you bloodbend her.
You traitor. I dedicated my life to you.
"You served me well, Lieutenant."
Mako. My bending...
Everything will be all right.
We just need to get out of here.
I'm impressed.
No one has ever gotten the better of me like that.
It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented.
Almost.
No!
Impossible!
I... I can airbend?
I can airbend!
"No, you don't!"
Did you see what happened?
Who was that?
Could that be...
 You bending tyrant.
 Evil Avatar.
What did you do to our leader?
 He's waterbending!
 What?
 He is a bender.
 The scar is fake.
The Avatar was telling the truth.
Noatak.
"It's over, brother."
I'm sorry for what I had to do to you.
Our father set us on this path.
Fate caused us to collide.
I should have left with you when we were boys.
Leave with me now.
We have a second chance.
We can start over together.
Please.
You're all I have left in the world.
"I can't believe Amon got you, too."
"Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending."
"Bro, not the time."
Right. Right. I'll just stand over here.
Quietly. In silence.
 You saved Republic City.
 But Amon got away.
Uncle Bumi's here!
Great.
Now I have to entertain my brother.
"The two of us together again, there's nothing we can't do."
"Yes, Noatak."
"""Noatak."""
I had almost forgotten the sound of my own name.
It will be just like the good old days.
"I've tried everything in my power, but I cannot restore Korra's bending."
But you're the best healer in the world.
You have to keep trying.
"I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do."
"Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed."
"It's going to be all right, Korra."
"No, it's not."
"Korra, wait."
Go away.
"I will, but I just want you to know"
I'm here for you.
"No, I mean go away, back to Republic City."
Get on with your life.
What are you talking about?
I'm not the Avatar anymore.
You don't need to do me any favors.
I don't care if you're the Avatar or not.
"Listen, when Tarrlok took you,"
I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again.
"I realized I love you, Korra."
I...
 I can't.
 Korra!
We need to be patient with her.
It will take time for her to accept what has happened.
"Not now, Tenzin."
I just want to be left alone.
But you called me here.
Aang.
You have finally connected with your spiritual self.
How?
"When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change."
"I love you, too."
Thank you.
"I am so proud of you, Avatar Korra."
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
"Six months ago,"
Avatar Korra defeated
Amon and the Equalists.
"Since then, the Council was disbanded and the United Republic elected its first president,"
"Tenzin's brother,"
"Commander Bumi, retired and moved to Air Temple Island and Korra and her boyfriend, Mako, have been the talk of the town."
"Peace has come to Republic City, but unbeknownst to the Avatar, danger now threatens the Southern Water Tribe."
 This your first watch?
 Mm-hmm.
" Well then, you'd better keep your eyes peeled, laddie."
You never know what creatures lurk in the murky depths.
" Uh, sir."
 What?
Aah!
Man overboard! Man overboard!
"It's Pro bending night in Republic City, and have we got a doozy for you."
"Fan favorites, the Fire Ferrets, are about to take on hot newcomers, the Rhino-Lions."
Now we all know that our last match was garbage.
Terrible.
Even Pabu could have done a better job.
"But that's in the past, because when you back a Fire Ferret in the corner, well, mister, he comes out fighting!"
So let's get out there and bend like there's no tomorrow.
Are you with me?
"Ooh, the Fire Ferrets go down in the water and right into the record books for the fastest knockout in pro-bending history."
 Where's Mako when I need him?
Looks like you had some car trouble.
Good thing the police are here.
I think these planes are finally ready to ship.
"I hate to mention the elephant-rhino in the room, but since your father was thrown in prison, no company will work with us."
We're nearly bankrupt.
 Don't worry.
I'm going to the South Pole to meet with someone who can help us put Future Industries back on top.
 Wah!
The Avatar is the winner!
 No fair.
You can't go into the Avatar State to win.
You did what?
The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket.
You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate.
"It's the ""Avatar State,"" and I'm the Avatar."
Who appreciates it more than me?
"Clearly, you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending."
 I have mastered airbending.
"Punch, punch, punch!"
See? Mastered.
Looks pretty good to me.
Is it too late for you to un-retire from the United Forces?
"The paperwork's gone through, little brother."
"From now on, it's 24/7 Bumi time!"
You've mastered
Korra-style airbending.
Now you need to master real airbending.
"Hopefully, our visit to all of the Air Temples will give you the inspiration you need to delve more deeply into your studies."
Can we see where
Grandpa Aang was born?
 How many lemurs can I have?
"I want to get tattoos, but instead of arrows"
I want lightning bolts.
 You can't get lightning bolts.
That doesn't make any sense.
 You don't make any sense!
" Fight, fight, fight!"
No one's fighting.
We're going to have a wonderful time.
"Now that the President is in office and I'm not needed on the Council,"
I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.
Great. More attention.
Relax?
I'd pay money to see that.
"Maybe I'll tag along just to see ""Vacation Tenzin."""
 You're not invited.
"Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're going to have some real fun in my hometown at the Glacier Spirits Festival."
"They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks."
Yay!
" Yep, there's Vacation Tenzin."
And you can't stop me from going to the festival.
Mom already invited me.
"So I walk up and say,"
"""Looks like you had some car trouble."
"Good thing the police are here."""
Did you write that beforehand?
"Yeah, I had a few others."
"Let's see, uh..."
"""Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad,"" huh?"
"Or, ""When you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya."""
" Ooh, I like that one."
" Okay, I'll use that next time."
"Beifong says if I keep it up,"
I could make detective soon.
" Oh, that sounds so fun."
All I do is train all day.
It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.
Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.
Of course you'd take his side.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm just...
 I'm gonna take a walk.
Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?
Gran-Gran!
" Oh, you've all gotten so big."
" We missed you, Aunt Kya."
" Oh, I missed you too."
Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough.
He's probably scared
I'll beat him up like when we were kids.
 I'm not scared of you... anymore.
 You remember Mako.
 Sir.
I hope you're not getting my daughter into any more trouble up in the city.
"Uh, no. I, uh... no."
"Knock it off, Dad."
" Wow, look at all these people that came out to greet us."
"Uh, no. They came to greet them."
The great chief of the Northern Water Tribe comes to grace us with his presence.
Hooray.
" Just relax, Tonraq."
He'll be gone soon enough.
" Whoa, who are the lovely ladies?"
"That's Eska and Desna, the chief's children."
Desna is a guy.
"Oh, no, sure. I knew that."
And which one is Desna?
"Good to see you again,"
Avatar Korra.
 Good to see you too.
 Tonraq.
 Brother.
"It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits, even during the most hallowed times."
I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival.
It's fun.
This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation.
Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.
Wha... what? It's so good.
 Traditions change.
It's not the end of the world.
Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters.
Some traditions have purpose.
" Wait, spirits are attacking ships?"
I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that.
Apparently you haven't been given all the information you need.
It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.
I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits.
Airbending is getting pretty boring.
 Tenzin is Korra's instructor.
He can give her all the training she needs.
 So you've said.
I'm glad you came with me to this meeting.
"Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business."
So you're my assistant.
Just stand there and don't say anything.
No problem.
Pabu and I are natural assistants.
"Man, this is nice."
"I gotta get into this whole ""business"" thing."
Did you see that? Levitation!
I was a foot off the ground.
Is that incredible or what?
 How does he do that?
 That's unbelievable.
 What?
It looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.
 Are you saying I wasn't levitating?
"Uh, no?"
" Well, why didn't anyone tell me?"
Now I look like an idiot!
"Swami, you're fired!"
 Aah!
" I like you, kid."
"You're a real straight shooter, just like me."
<i>Ms. Sate'? He's with you'?
 Mm-hmm.</i>
"Brought your tiger-shark with you to do business, huh?"
Now that's moxie.
Get over here and pop a squat.
"Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests."
 Thank you for meeting with me.
"As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping..."
 Sure.
"But first, you gotta check out my new venture: moving pictures."
"Zhu Li, do the thing."
You're gonna love this.
"Mind-blowing, right?"
 Yeah.
" Now, forget that!"
That's the past!
"Shut it off, Zhu Li!"
Imagine watching this.
"Ginger, come over here and do your poses."
 Spectacular.
And we tell a story.
"There's romance, action, some funny animal stuff for the kids."
"You know, whatever."
"Thanks, Ginger."
Go rest your gams.
"How about that, tiger-shark?"
"We're gonna do big business with these ""movers,"" as I call 'em."
 Okay
But I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track.
If we could hammer out a deal...
 Stop.
Look me in the eye.
We got a deal!
We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight.
Now who wants a rocket-boat ride?
Is that how business usually goes?
 You are a natural assistant.
"This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle."
 This is nothing.
"When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits."
People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.
Wow. I've never seen that.
" And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits."
"That is why I want so badly to teach you, to help you fulfill your destiny."
 I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.
Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn.
It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.
I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?
We all did what we thought was best for you.
"Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's."
Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.
" Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin."
You know he's always been sensitive.
 I'm not sensitive!
"As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits."
But I am saddened to see what it has become... a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.
 I fear the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay.
Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters.
I only hope we are not too late to change course.
" Chief Unalaq, everybody."
Always great to have him in town.
Now let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's dancin' otter-penguins.
 Mm-mm.
Wish me luck.
I'm making my move.
Whee!
 Good luck.
Those two have always creeped me out.
They smell like a grandma's attic.
"Hey, I'm Bolin."
I'm a friend of Korra's.
"You're Eska, right?"
"Wow, I'm just..."
I'm loving these robes.
"So you are from the North, right? Cool."
"That's like... you know, that's, like, my favorite direction."
 I think he is trying to establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin.
 Perhaps it would be interesting to spend time with a person whose ways are so rough and uncultured.
You amuse me.
I will make you mine.
You mean like a boyfriend or... or like a slave?
 Yes.
Win me prizes.
 Unalaq offered to train me.
He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them.
Sounds good.
What does Tenzin think?
 Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids.
I'll never finish training with him in charge.
 We have a winner.
" I mean, you heard what Unalaq said."
"The South is spiritually unbalanced, and it's the Avatar's job to fix it."
But my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me.
Well?
" Well, what?"
 What do you think I should do?
I guess you should do what you think is right.
I support whatever decision you make.
"Oh, thanks. That's a big help."
I thought you wanted me to be supportive.
Now you want me to tell you what I think?
Make up your mind.
Oof!
 Just forget it.
Ugh.
"Naga, what are you doing?"
"Naga, hush."
"Quiet, Naga."
You'll wake everyone up.
What's going on?
 What is that?
Ugh!
 Got it!
Don't got it!
 Korra!
Aah!
 Aah!
" Spirit, why are you angry with us?"
What have we done to offend you?
 Go in peace.
" Korra, are you all right?"
How were you able to control that spirit when no one else could?
" As your father could tell you,"
I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways.
"All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know."
"Chief Unalaq, clearly, you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending, and I hope that going to the Air Temples will help her connect with the past Avatars."
 Ugh!
The Air Temples will teach her nothing.
Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.
 I've told you that will not happen.
" Hey, I'm right here!"
Anyone want to ask me what I think?
" Korra, please, listen."
I'm tired of listening to you... both of you.
"You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best, but both of you were powerless against the spirit attack."
I think it's time I had a new teacher.
" Now, Korra..."
 Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn.
I have to go with him.
" Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together."
" I'm sorry, Tenzin."
This is as far as we go.
" It has been a pleasure serving you,"
Avatar Korra.
 I think you forgot a couple of things.
" Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now."
" This is your family, Tenzin."
"When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings."
"Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together."
" Come on, it'll be fun."
"I'm dying to see that laid-back ""Vacation Tenzin"""
I've heard so much about.
All right. Hop on.
"I love you, Mom."
We'll see you soon.
Oh!
 Do you think I did the right thing?
I don't know.
"I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing."
But I know your heart is in the right place.
You'll just have to trust it.
"I know this was a hard decision, Korra."
But it was the right one.
Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training.
I have great plans for you.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements an bring balance to the world.
The Southern
Water Tribe is under siege.
"When Avatar Korra was attacked by a ark spirit,"
Chief Unalaq was the only one able to stop it.
So Korra turned her back on Tenzin an chose Unalaq as her new spiritual mentor.
"Tenzin an his family left for a vacation at the Southern Air Temple, while Korra remains in the Water Tribe."
Will she be able to restore balance between humans an spirits?
 You're early.
 What can I say?
I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.
I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits.
I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training.
We're going to one of the most remote places in the world... the long-neglected spiritual center of your tribe: the South Pole.
You're gonna train me at the South Pole?
 We will do more than just train.
"By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, an now it threatens to destroy our tribe."
We must set things right.
The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.
 A dangerous trip to the South Pole?
Count me in.
"There it is, the Southern Air Temple."
Isn't it magnificent?
" Master Tenzin, welcome."
"Good to see you again,"
Abbot Shung.
 Is there anything you need?
Water? Dandelion greens?
"Ah, perhaps you' like to re-center yourself by mediating in the gardens."
" No, thank you."
I'm fine.
An you must be the honorable Pema.
"Please, accept these gifts."
This is an ancient
Airbender head shaver we've refurbished just for you.
 Oh... okay.
"An Pema, these flowers once filled the mountainside."
Now they can brighten up your room.
 That's... sweet?
You didn't have to.
 Nonsense.
Whatever you need is yours.
Anything for the mother of the next generation of Airbenders.
 No! That gift is mine.
 You don't even like to read.
 Naah.
"Yep, those are the world's next generation of Airbenders."
" Mommy, Day, look."
I finally got a lemur.
I'm gonna name him Poki.
"Poki, come back!"
 Ugh.
Phew.
"Excuse me, a little help here."
"Sorry, I thought you were the servants."
 We're Tenzin's brother an sister.
 Avatar Aang ha other children?
The world is filled with more Airbenders?
 We're not Airbenders.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
 I thought you said Bolin was coming.
"He said he' be here, but I can't worry about it."
I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip.
"Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine."
" Tonraq, what do you want?"
I hear you're taking
Korra to the South Pole.
I'm coming.
 Absolutely not.
You're a distraction to Korra an a hindrance to what needs to be one.
 My daughter is not going without me.
She needs someone to watch after her.
"Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?"
 Because he's misguided.
The sa truth is it's men like your father who have put the spirit world out of balance.
He's ignore my warnings in the past an hasn't learned since.
 What happened in the past?
 It doesn't matter.
What matters is the Everstorm.
 The Everstorm?
 It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades.
"I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me."
"Guys! Hey, wait for me!"
Check it out.
I'm traveling in style.
"Whoa! Okay, I'm sorry."
Still getting use to that throttle.
" Uh, where'd you get the ride?"
Varrick. He's awesome.
He also gave me this fancy snowsuit.
"It's inflatable with an internal heater, emergency beacon, an food ration pouch."
"I mean, if I get lost,"
"I can survive in this thing for, like, like, a month."
Who wants some freeze-dried cucumber-quats?
Nobody?
Di I interrupt a conversation?
" No, the conversation is over."
"Dad, come if you want."
Just don't interfere with my training.
Does this sidecar have the capacity for two passengers?
 Sure does.
"But, uh, who's gonna rive?"
" Well, what do you know?"
Looks like...
" Go away, Mako."
"So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?"
You will open an ancient spirit portal.
I'm sorry. What now?
"At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the spirit world."
But it has long been close.
An that's why the evil spirits are attacking?
There are no evil spirits.
There is light an ark in them all.
"But when they're unbalance, the darkness takes over."
"If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restore."
" What do you mean ""in time""?"
There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ens on the winter solstice.
That's when the spirit world an the physical world are close together.
Only then can the Avatar open the portal.
 The winter solstice is tomorrow.
 Exactly.
An we can't afford to wait another year.
"Easy, Naga."
 What are those?
 Dark spirits.
 Let's keep moving.
We have to fin a safe place to set up camp.
"Uncle, why do you think the ark spirits are following us?"
"Can we not talk about ark spirits, please?"
 My brother doesn't like ghost stories.
 Don't worry.
"I will protect you, my feeble turtle-duck."
 Thank you.
" Sadly, this isn't a ghost story."
This is real.
The spirits are angry because he's here.
Haven't you ever wondered how your father ended up in the South Pole?
Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the north?
" Unalaq, this is not the time."
 You're right.
You should have told her a long time ago.
 Told me what?
 I left the North Pole because...
I was banished.
 You were banished from the North? Why?
Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe.
"20 years ago, I was a general in the Northern Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people."
" Brother, we're being attacked."
I drove them out of the city and deep into the frozen tundra.
We tracked them deep into an ancient forest.
"Many believe this forest was the home to spirits, an the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack on such hallowed grounds."
They thought wrong.
" We capture the barbarians, but in the process, we destroyed the forest."
I didn't realize the consequences of what I ha one.
"By destroying the forest,"
I unknowingly let loose angry spirits.
They threatened to destroy everything.
The entire city.
"Unalaq was able to guide the spirits back to the forest, but by then, the damage ha been one."
"For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame."
That's when I came to the South an started a new life.
 Whoa.
"So you were suppose to be chief, then he became chief."
No wonder you guys don't like each other.
Ow! What?
Isn't that what happened?
I can't believe you kept this from me.
 I was protecting you from the shame
I brought on the family.
 Why do you keep hiding things from me an then telling me it's for my own protection?
I'm tire of you protecting me.
 Korra.
Wow.
The statue room.
" That's right, Jinora."
The most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple.
Here you will fin statues of every Avatar who ever live.
Where are your brother an sister?
 You can't catch me.
I'm the greatest air skater of all time.
Oof!
Meelo!
"Korra, you have every right to be ma at me, but I don't want you to make the same mistake I made."
"I should have never gone into that forest, an we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now."
Spirits an the physical world should remain separate.
" Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits an the physical world, an I finally have a chance to live up to my potential."
You don't even know if what Unalaq says is true.
 You want proof?
Look to the sky.
"Where I'm from, the spirits are at peace an they light up the ark."
 The Northern lights.
 Yes.
There use to be lights in the South as well.
"But during the 100 Year War, the South was thrown out of balance an the lights disappeared."
"When the war ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically as a nation."
But we have not rebuilt you spiritually.
Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies.
"Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm."
 I think we're here.
 Is that what I think it is?
 We must keep moving.
" Oh, man."
I really don't like this.
" Bolin, just stay calm."
There's no reason to...
Panic!
 Aah!
" Korra, look out!"
" Oh, it's in the engine!"
 Is everyone okay?
I can't stop it.
I'll save you.
I'm a raft!
"Uh, can someone please deflate me?"
Thank you.
" Oh, great."
There goes our equipment.
Now what are we suppose to o?
 There's only one thing to o.
We have to turn back.
 No.
The solstice is tonight.
We're so close.
 This mission is too dangerous.
We're leaving.
" No, Dad."
You're leaving.
" Don't worry, sir."
I'll keep an eye on Korra for you.
" Thank you, Mako."
Let's open this portal an lea your father an the entire Southern Water Tribe in the right direction.
We don't have much time.
 Then what are we waiting for?
"So, what exactly were you an my a talking about?"
 Nothing.
"He was just worried about you, that's all."
"You know, sometimes"
I wonder whose side you're on.
 There aren't any sides.
We all just want to help however we can.
You have to trust that we're here for you.
 We've arrive.
 Trees frozen in ice.
 It's just like the sacred forest
Tonraq destroyed in the north.
 So what do I do?
You must fin your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies.
"From here, you're on your own."
 Wait a second.
There's no way she's going alone.
" Yeah, if she goes, we go too."
 The Avatar must go alone.
But I don't have any connection with the spirits.
"In fact, it seems like they hate me."
You have to believe in yourself like I believe in you.
What is it?
 I guess I'm just so use to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me.
"Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you."
Let them guide you.
Let them help you fin the light in the ark.
 Wait here.
I'll be okay.
Goo luck.
The spirit portal.
Amazing.
What Avatar is this?
 The light in the ark.
Why isn't it opening?
"Come on, portal. Open!"
Oof!
The spirits dancing in the sky.
 I can't believe it.
 It's beautiful.
 She did it.
" Hey, Korra, you're back!"
"Hey, Korra's back."
Wha... huh?
Why are you initiating physical contact with another woman?
 Everything you said was true.
"Avatar Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South, an soon, the whole world."
 You never cease to amaze me.
 Thanks.
"By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain."
Things were really stressful an confusing.
It's hard being the Avatar.
It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.
What are all your
Northern troops doing here?
Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern Water Tribe back on its righteous path.
There's more difficult work to be one before our two tribes are truly unite.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Korra has reopened the southern spirit portal and taken the first step to restoring balance between spirits and man.
"Meanwhile, tensions are high between Korra and her father after she discovered he was hiding a dark secret... years ago,"
Tonraq was banished from the North.
And now the Northern navy has landed on Southern shores.
What other plans does Unalaq have for the Avatar?
"Everyone, clear the streets."
Get back in your homes.
"Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?"
"Now that you've opened the southern portal, we need to protect it from people who would do the spirits harm."
 I can protect it.
I need you for something more important.
There is another portal in the North.
"Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds."
 But the solstice is over.
How am I going to open it?
The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North.
"And now that you've opened the southern portal, your energy is stronger as well."
"With both portals open, our tribes will be united again."
 The world will be united again.
"Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since..."
 Wahoo!
 And it's over.
" Good morning, universe!"
"Bumi, please. Cover yourself."
" Well, lookee here."
"""Vacation Tenzin"" has finally decided to join us."
" Yes, he has."
It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family.
"Isn't that right, my little Rohan?"
And I've really enjoyed having you two around.
Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.
"Uh, I think your memory is a little foggy."
Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations.
It was always just you and Dad.
" No, that can't be right."
What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant-koi?
Nope. We weren't there.
 Hmm.
"Oh, remember Ember Island?"
Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach?
 You mean you built.
We never saw the place.
 I could've sworn...
 Woo-hoo!
" Morning, kids."
" Morning, Uncle Bumi."
Do you have a baby in there?
 Where's your sister?
<i>'</i> Who?
Ikki. About this tall.
Talks real fast.
I'm sure you know her.
" Uh... there was a lemur fight, but the bison told us not to worry because a giant was coming."
Then we almost got eaten by a shark-squid.
The shark-squid? He's here?
It appears my old nemesis has found me.
"Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?"
 I don't know.
Maybe. Yes.
 She ran away.
"Honestly, I don't know why you kids can't just get along!"
" It's all right, dear."
Ikki couldn't have gone far.
I'll find her.
 Commander Bumi reporting for duty!
Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty.
 What do you say we all go together?
Sure. I could use the help.
"When I get back, we'll come up with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all."
 Yeah!
" Thank you for coming, everyone."
I know these last few days have been very troubling.
 Troubling?
Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it.
This is shocking.
"Nay, sickening!"
But these kale cookies?
Opposite.
Remind me to get the recipe later.
" What's your point, Varrick?"
" My point is,"
Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace.
How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies we can eat?
 Probably a couple of days.
"Rhetorical question, Zhu Li."
You gotta keep up.
"Not to mention I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting, thanks to this harbor lockdown."
Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish?
"Seriously, it's not rhetorical."
I need to sell these fish.
Chief Unalaq is here to help the South.
He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.
The only spirit
I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of independence!
"Am I right, people?"
 All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.
" No, he wants control of our wealth."
My wealth. And I like my wealth.
"If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom!"
You want to start a war?
Are you crazy?
" Unalaq started this, not us."
I'm sorry.
"Maybe you could speak with your uncle, tell him how frustrated we all are."
He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say.
Do it for me?
 I'll do it for the tribe.
 I cannot stop eating these things.
"Look, we all know where this conflict is heading."
We need to start preparing for war.
I will hate to leave this quaint tribe.
" Is that true, Eska?"
"Of course not, Desna."
I will not miss it at all.
I hold immense dislike for the South.
Bolin!
Laugh at my humorous quip.
"Yes, dear."
So... so funny.
"You know, I'll be really sad when you have to leave."
It's been really great getting to know you.
Really.
But you will be coming with me to the North.
There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss.
Foolish Bolin.
Mako! I'm so happy to see you!
" Uh, you all right, bro?"
"No! No, I'm not all right!"
I can't take any more.
"Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska!"
Don't make me!
"Oh, please, please don't make me."
"Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her."
Break up with her?
You can do that?
Yeah. Guys do it all the time.
 How?
Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.
"Oh, no, no,"
I don't think she'd like that.
 Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a bloodsucking leech.
You just gotta rip it off and get it over with.
You'll feel a lot better afterwards.
Trust me.
"Thanks, Mako. Whew."
I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts.
Korra better watch out.
"Ooh, no, it's just a... uh, you kn... uh, never mind."
Our next training session isn't until tomorrow.
 I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's about our conversation this morning.
 Yes?
"I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message."
 Your father has been talking to you.
Not just him. Varrick too.
There was a meeting at my parents' house.
A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.
 I am their chief.
"I'm uniting, not invading."
"I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war."
" If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides."
"The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man that would be catastrophic."
 How do we stop it?
 We?
"No, Korra."
This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.
 I'm usually the one starting fights.
I don't know how to stop them from happening.
"As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict."
"You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes find unity."
 Maybe Tenzin was right.
Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.
 Tenzin lacked faith in you.
But I have no doubt you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.
" Thank you, Uncle."
 Who threw those?
"You hoodlums think you're tough, huh?"
Pick on a Waterbender your own size!
<i>'</i> Stop!
Tell these thugs to go back to the North.
They're not welcome here anymore!
These Southerners need to stay in line.
" Everyone, calm down."
You're all part of the same tribe.
Start acting like it.
 You're taking their side?
We thought you were one of us.
 I'm not taking anyone's side.
Hey!
 You're the worst Avatar ever!
" Everyone, walk away from this."
They're not worth our trouble.
Go back to your homes.
"Korra, I..."
Korra!
 Ikki!
Ikki!
Ikki?
"Ikki, where are you?"
"Over here, Dad!"
Just kidding. It's me!
 There's no sign of her anywhere.
 Why would Ikki run off like this?
"Ah, it's probably my fault."
 Probably.
 Excuse me?
" I'm guessing you've been so busy with your ""duty"" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids."
Duty.
" What are you, five years old?"
" Kya, you're right."
I haven't been spending enough time with them.
I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.
"Tenzin, your problem is you're exactly like Dad."
He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty... don't laugh... that he never had time for us.
 Dad was under a lot of pressure.
"He always had time for you, though, his precious little Airbender."
 Dad loved us all equally.
"Besides, it all happened a long time ago."
Why are we even talking about this?
"Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood."
Guess what. We didn't.
 We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.
" See what he's doing there, Bumi?"
Classic Airbender technique.
Cutting and running when things get tough!
 Ugh.
Yeah.
Did Dad teach you that move?
" How was your day, sweetie?"
" Oh, fabulous."
"My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me?"
No! And I didn't ask for my father's help.
Can't he just let me be the Avatar?
" Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen?"
I'm still not clear on that.
 Ugh. I'm sorry.
My dad just gets me all worked up.
"How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner?"
Just the two of us.
"Isn't this fun, huh?"
"We never get to spend enough time together, just the five of us."
So fun.
Excuse us while we retrieve more sustenance.
 You guys gotta save me.
I thought you were breaking up with her.
What happened to ripping off the leech?
 I tried!
"But any time I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin-piranhas!"
So it was more like you tugged at the leech.
"Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off."
Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands?
"Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious."
"No, no, not to me, it wasn't."
I'm very bad at reading people.
You should know that by now.
"Oh, man."
Oh!
"Do something, Avatar!"
" You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission"
I commanded years ago in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.
Here we go.
"For five days, we scoured that beast of a mountain, fighting our way through blizzards, sandstorms, and three typhoons."
"Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death."
"With no time to lose,"
I piled all 12 of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety.
And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?
 It was supposed to inspire you.
"Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men."
That's probably why the Avatar fired you.
 I'm sick of your far-fetched tales.
Three typhoons?
"Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but..."
Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here.
I found footprints!
 Come on!
" No, follow me!"
This will get us down
50 times faster.
"Bumi, it's pitch black, and the rocks are slippery."
You're gonna hurt yourself.
" Come on, you wimps!"
"If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders."
 Fine.
"You were right, Bumi!"
That was faster!
"At least 50 times faster, by my calculations."
"Oh, Tenzin's the funny guy now."
"If you need an airlift down, just say the word."
" Bah, I don't need your help."
I've got everything under control.
Agh!
 Bumi!
 Did Dad send you to talk to me?
 Your father doesn't know I'm here.
"Korra, what's going on between you two?"
 Ask Dad.
"I've tried, but he won't talk about it."
"Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this."
You want to know what's been going on?
I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life.
"Unalaq told me everything... how Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained, how Dad got banished from the North."
 So the truth is out.
 You knew.
And you never said anything.
"We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood."
 I never wanted a normal childhood.
"All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar, but everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents!"
Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.
" That's not true, Korra."
"No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?"
The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born.
You can't expect to undo them in a day.
 So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?
"No, but this situation might be out of your control."
Varrick's been plotting a rebellion against Unalaq.
"He asked your father to join, and..."
 Dad is part of a rebellion?
"I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it."
" It's too late, Mom."
I'm already in the middle of it.
 Korra!
 Uncle!
"Oh, no."
Uncle?
Dad?
" Dad, don't do this."
" Turn around, Avatar, and pretend you didn't see anything."
 No. Leave Unalaq and go.
"I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped."
We can still avoid a war.
" No, we can't."
 Get him out of here!
We're all part of the same tribe.
I don't want to hurt you.
Oof!
" Dad, stop!"
"Why did you do this, Dad?"
What? Who are you?
Where's my father?
 He wouldn't help us.
"He's a traitor, just like you."
Thank you for saving my life.
 I'm just glad I got here in time.
 Find Varrick.
I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.
" Wait, you can't just lock them away."
That will only make the South angrier.
 You want them to go free?
" No, but let them stand trial for what they did."
Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.
 Very well.
I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.
" Thank you, Uncle."
 I told you those rocks were slippery.
You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.
" You done with the lecture, Mom?"
" Oh, grow up."
You haven't changed one bit since we were kids.
You're still trying to prove you can do everything a bender can.
"Well, you can't. Deal with it."
 And you're not our mother.
You don't get to tell me what I can and can't do.
Deal with that. Ugh!
 Good luck healing yourself with your special non-bending powers.
" Hey, back me up here, Tenzin."
 Kya's right.
"You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest."
I had to become the responsible one.
You think you're the responsible one?
Where were you after Dad died and Mom was all alone?
Because I was the only one who packed up and moved my whole life to be with her.
"Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself."
It was time for you to settle down somewhere.
You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire culture on your shoulders.
" Oh, boo-hoo."
"Must've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant-koi all day."
"Oh, so that's what this is all about."
That's what it's always been about.
You think you're some savior who has to carry on Dad's legacy.
 Who else is going to do it?
 How about all of us?
" Yeah, we're Aang's kids too."
We never should have come on this vacation.
 I couldn't agree more.
"Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place."
I can't be around you two right now.
Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned.
I'll keep looking out here.
 Fine.
 Fine.
 Fine.
 Is it okay if I come in?
Of course.
We heard what happened.
Are you okay?
 I'm so glad you weren't there.
I don't know what I would have done.
I had no idea how far
Varrick was willing to go.
"My brother and I have our differences, but I would never attack him."
"I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels, and for all the pain"
I've caused you and Mom.
 I'm the one who should apologize.
"After I saw the southern lights return,"
I was so proud of you.
I never should have held you back.
"When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family."
"But then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over."
"We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore."
"Mom, Dad, of course I still need you."
 We weren't expecting you.
"Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial."
 Trial? For what?
 For conspiring to assassinate me.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes have reached a breaking point.
"After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South,"
"Varrick incited an uprising, but Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle."
"Enraged by the insurrection,"
"Unalaq arrested the rebels and Korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him."
Will Korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war?
 You're making a mistake.
 I wish it hadn't come to this.
"But your parents held meetings with the rebels, right here in their home."
I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.
"Rest assured,"
I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial.
He is the most fair and honorable man I know.
" Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you."
" I'm sure you're right, so we should have nothing to worry about."
 I hope so.
 Where's Varrick?
We should've closed our deal an hour ago.
Would you relax?
This place is great.
And the best part about it?
Eska doesn't know I'm here.
 Ee-yah.
I wasn't hiding.
"Hey, hey-hey, hey."
 I'm not on the hunt for you... currently.
 We search for Varrick.
Our father wishes him to stand trial.
 What did he do?
" He is a traitor to the Water Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle."
 What?
 Korra's parents were arrested?
Yes. Your powers of deduction are impressive.
" Yeah, he's a cop."
 Varrick's not here.
 Very well.
"Desna, let us continue our search elsewhere."
Boyfriend!
Bow to me when I exit.
"Yes, yes, my sweet koala-otter."
 You are so cute when you grovel.
 Don't let her treat you that way.
Stand up for yourself.
" I tried to break up with her, but Mako gave me terrible advice."
"Thank you, Mako."
"Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?"
" Bolin, you need to be honest with her."
Tell her how you really feel.
"Honesty is for fools, kid!"
 Varrick?
"If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce."
"Disappear, like I did!"
 Where are you?
Somewhere
Unalaq will never find me.
Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?
 The coast is clear.
You can come out.
" No way, mister."
"Not until I know it's absolutely, 157% safe."
"Ahh! Thank you, Zhu Li."
 Your assistant's in there too?
 Zhu Li never leaves my side.
Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck!
You forgot the honey!
"Sorry, sir."
There isn't any in here.
 No honey?
"We're in a bear, for crying out loud!"
I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing.
"Bolin, I got a little something for you 'round back."
 Wow!
 Now listen up.
"Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it, so I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison."
 What's the money for?
"Bribery, of course!"
There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans.
"I think I catch your drift,"
Varrick-bear.
 Ikki!
"Ikki, where are you?"
Shoo!
Go bother someone else.
You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.
"Okay, everybody here?"
 Ikki!
"Oh, thank goodness."
"Juniper Lightning Bug, paws off the table!"
This is going to be a civilized breakfast.
"Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so... be quiet and listen up!"
We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world.
But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here because they stink.
Oh!
"Hi, Daddy."
I guess you found me.
Do I have to go now?
"Actually, is there room for one more?"
" Uh, sure."
You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead.
"Nice to meet you,"
Blueberry Spicehead.
" And that's Princess Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's"
Juniper Lightning Bug.
They're my new brothers and sisters.
" New ones, huh?"
Can they be my new brothers and sisters too?
"Maybe, but only if they say it's okay."
"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"No, no, he's nice."
They say it's okay.
 We're good to go.
I gave all the money to some guys over there.
"I told them to ""take care of it,"" and then I winked."
Pretty sure they got the message.
 This trial will now come to order!
Judge Hotah presiding.
 Man! I should have paid him!
" Yeah, you think?"
I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked.
"They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me."
"According to Unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war."
Is that true?
 Yes.
And were these men present at that meeting?
" Well, yes, but..."
And where exactly did this meeting take place?
 Objection!
 Quiet down out there!
I'll ask you one more time.
Where did the meeting happen?
 My parents' house.
 And who led this meeting?
" Your Honor, if I may..."
 May what?
 May I... declare a mistrial?
 Sit down.
"Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?"
 My parents are innocent!
 I've heard all I need to.
I'll return shortly with my decision.
" Hey there, Eska!"
I was wondering if we could talk.
I grant you permission to speak freely.
"Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you."
"You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark, but I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading."
 I agree.
It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it.
" Ch! Oh, yes!"
I am so glad you understand!
" Nothing, that is, except marriage."
We will wed at sunset.
You may express your joy through tears.
"Oh, no, I can't..."
This is really tight.
" Senna, please step forward."
I have found you innocent.
You are free to go.
 Korra!
" On the charge of treason, you are all found guilty."
The punishment for this crime is death.
 You can't do this!
"You take their lives, and I'll take yours."
" Korra, calm down."
I'll talk to him.
"I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider."
Show these men and my brother mercy.
 Very well.
I'll change their punishment.
"Your lives will be spared, but you will live them out in prison."
" Thank you, Uncle."
"You like that, don't you,"
Blueberry Spicehead?
"Yes, you do."
"You know, I could get used to it here."
No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.
We should have Uncle Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit.
I bet they'd like it too.
 Let's not.
They'll only spoil our good mood.
 What do you mean?
Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling.
"And Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world."
 But what about Meelo?
He's hilarious too.
You never know what's going to come out of his mouth.
And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.
 And mean.
And bossy.
"Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?"
 I couldn't agree with you more.
But I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you.
"Even though Twinkle Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other."
" That's very wise of you, Ikki."
"We should probably head back, huh?"
 I suppose.
We can't hide in this cave forever.
" Don't worry, Daddy."
We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead.
I know you really bonded with her.
" Yes, I'd like that."
"Honey, are you all right?"
 I'm fine.
"Good, then let's bust you out of here right now."
" Korra, no."
Saving me would start a war.
"If fighting were to break out, the North would crush the South."
I'll be all right.
Just promise me you won't do anything rash.
 Fine.
I promise.
" It's okay, Mom."
 L-I hate feeling so helpless.
 I know.
Uh!
<i>- Ow.</i>
What do you want?
 It's not about what I want.
"It's about what Naga wants, and she'd like you to let my father out of prison."
"I-I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do."
I was just following Unalaq's orders.
 What are you talking about?
 I-I've said too much.
Unless you wanna be
"Naga's afternoon snack, you better keep talking."
L-I've worked for your uncle for years!
He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.
 So Unalaq told you what to say?
 Yes! Every word.
Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?
" He's trying to keep you on his side, but he also wants your father out of the way, just like when he got your father banished."
What do you mean
"""he got my father banished""?"
Nothing!
 Keep talking.
"Hey there, Dad."
You're looking well.
"Look, uh, I'm sorry"
"I didn't turn out to be an Airbender like you hoped, but I've tried my best to keep the world safe."
Hope I made you proud.
"Of course he'd be proud of you, Bumi."
" Kya! I-I was just, uh... cleaning off Dad's statue."
It's so dusty in here.
 Come here.
" Thanks, Kya."
You always know when I need a hug.
 Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!
I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go.
 What happened?
I found out the truth about my dad's banishment.
"Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe, then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them."
 Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief.
It was a setup.
 Just like the whole trial.
I can't believe I trusted him.
I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail.
I need your help.
"If you do this, there's no going back."
 I know.
Will you help me or not?
" Of course, I'll help."
 Me too.
Count me in!
 I don't even want to know.
So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?
"No, no, the honesty thing worked out great... so great that she decided we should get married!"
 Sorry.
 I'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace.
 I guess Eska didn't get the memo.
"Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast."
"Lucky for you,"
Varrick's got your back.
Now gather 'round Ping-Ping.
Let's talk plan.
 My dad's in there.
Where is he?
" I'm sorry, Korra."
You'll never see your father again.
 Where's my father?
On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe.
He'll serve out his sentence there.
 Bring him back or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army.
 Remember who you are.
"As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war."
You must remain neutral or our tribes will never find unity.
 You don't want unity.
You want power.
"You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you?"
"You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father."
No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.
All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny.
" Well, I don't want your help anymore."
" If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South, and even I will be powerless to stop them."
 I'm done being manipulated by you.
"You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North."
 And why would I do that?
Because you still need me to open the northern portal.
" No, I don't."
You've served your purpose.
 Aah!
 Uh!
" If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father."
 Let's go.
 You have a license for that animal?
"Uh, you fellahs seen a traveling circus come through here?"
" Zhu Li, do the thing."
That platypus-bear is pooping money!
 Where's your dad?
 On a ship headed north.
Think we can catch up to it?
"Sure, once you get us past our friends from the North."
If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships.
I could waterbend them out of the way.
"A plane? Well, why didn't you say so?"
"Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?"
"In case the boat sinks, of course."
 But there's no runway.
How are we supposed to take off?
Zhu Li! Take a note:
"""Build runway."""
" Yes, sir."
 I have an idea.
. Now!
"Captain, you are never gonna believe this."
There! My dad's on that ship!
Jump!
<i>- Whoa-ah'.!</i>
 Where are the prisoners?
" Korra, this is crazy."
You promised me you wouldn't do anything rash.
I had to. I'll explain later.
 Sweetie! You're okay!
Oh! I was so worried!
Do you have something you wanna say to your sister?
" Ikki, I'm glad you're back."
"Yeah, sorry we made fun of you."
Thanks. Wanna play air ball?
 Sure!
 Yeah!
I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday.
I've worked so hard to celebrate Dad's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal.
And we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with Dad out on you.
" Yeah, you didn't deserve that."
I thought you two might wanna see this.
Mom gave it to me before we left.
"That is one good-looking family, huh?"
 That's one happy family.
" So once I knew the truth,"
I couldn't sit by and do nothing.
 My own brother betrayed me... and our entire tribe.
 What's our next move?
I've been running from my past for too long.
It's time to put my brother in his place.
"You have our support,"
Chief Tonraq.
 Mine too.
"I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad."
" No, Korra."
But you said the South doesn't stand a chance against Unalaq's forces.
I can help.
 The best way for you to help is by getting the President of the United Republic on our side.
"The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while, but we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war."
"All right,"
I'll get you all the help you need.
"I love you, Dad."
 I love you too.
" I really need to thank you, Korra."
For what? I started a civil war.
 Exactly!
Now Eska and I are officially broken up.
" Oh, looks like we have company, and not the fun kind!"
 What is that?
 That would be my darling Eska.
Quick question:
Is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?
 Why do you think I built this boat?
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
It's brother versus brother in the War of the Water Tribes.
"After Korra discovered that Chief Unalaq betrayed her and her father, she turned against him, sparking civil war."
"The Southern rebels rallied around Tonraq, but they are vastly outnumbered."
So Korra is headed to Republic City to seek aid.
But will she be able to convince President Raiko to send troops to help the South?
"Welcome home, Avatar."
Thanks for starting a war.
 I didn't start a war.
"Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem."
" Mako, I want you back on the beat."
There's going to be a Southern
Water Tribe peace march tonight.
I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand.
 I'm all yours.
 I'll go too.
The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.
Great.
That should calm them down.
 Maybe you should sit this out.
 What?
I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse.
You could at least try to seem neutral.
I'm not neutral.
The North invaded my home.
The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.
Zhu Li's already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow.
We'll get him on board.
Whatever. I gotta go to work.
 I better go check on my factory.
I'm going to find out about this peace march.
 And I am dying for a pedicure!
" So, uh, what should I be doing?"
" I don't know, Bolin."
Figure something out.
"Say, kid, have you ever seen"
Republic City at night?
"Sure, I live here."
 Have you really seen it?
 Y... no?
That's what I thought.
Come on.
Tonraq and the rebels are holed up here in the hills outside of town.
 Leave them.
My brother's no threat to us up there.
Increase security around the spirit portal.
Keeping it safe is our number one priority.
" Yes, sir."
 I need you two to go after the Avatar.
She's the only one who can open the northern spirit portal.
" But, Father, you told Korra..."
I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear.
I'll find her.
She stole my husband.
 I need her alive.
Fine.
"Watch me, Poki."
You lay down and roll over.
Roll over.
" No, no, you can't just demonstrate it."
That never works.
 Good.
" Ugh, classic over-rewarding."
" Poki, where are you going?"
 Command respect.
"Having some trouble, son?"
 Poki isn't very good at learning.
"Believe me, I know the feeling."
Maybe I can help.
How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?
 Yeah!
Tensions are running high outside of the Southern Water
Tribe Cultural Center.
"The Avatar is leading a group of Southerners in a peaceful protest against Chief Unalaq, but the Northerners have come out in droves in support of their leader."
Boo!
 Get out of here!
 Boo!
 Get a real job!
 Get out of here!
 You stink!
 Hey!
Stop!
Republic City Police.
The Northern Water Tribe is out of control.
I saw a firebender running away from the blast.
The North might not be responsible for this.
Of course they're responsible.
Who else would it be?
 Wow.
"Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock."
Being famous is like getting hit with a rock all the time.
Look! It's Bolin!
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!
"Folks, that cheer you're hearing is for local favorite, Bolin, of the Fire Ferrets."
Let's see if we can get a quick interview.
Bolin!
"Bolin, the Fire Ferrets are out for the season."
How have you been spending your time lately?
"Well, I took a trip south for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war..."
 But there's nowhere I'd rather be than Pro Bending Night in Republic City!
"Am I right, people?"
Republic City!
 Do you miss being in the ring?
" Well, I definitely don't miss getting hit with things all the time and the humiliating losing."
"I mean, that gets pretty old."
"You know, sometimes I actually cry myself to sleep..."
I guess what I miss the most are these fans!
They're the greatest fans in the world!
Give it up for the fans!
"Look how these people love you, kid."
They're eating that cornball spiel right out of your hand.
"The trick is, whenever I get confused,"
"I just say ""Republic City"" or ""fans,"" and then everyone cheers."
I think I just figured out your true calling.
I hope President Raiko listens to us.
 Don't worry.
I was a big contributor to his election campaign.
Him and the other guy.
Gotta hedge your bets.
" Hello, Mr. President."
"Sir, the Southern Water Tribe..."
 Just a second.
Keep smiling.
 Eh...
"Now, how can I help the Avatar and my most generous supporter?"
Unalaq's troops have invaded the South.
We need you to send the United Forces to help.
"I'm very concerned by what's happening down there, but I don't think it's the Republic's place to interfere with internal Water Tribe matters."
Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe.
He lied his way onto the Northern throne.
" Mr. President, the Republic is already involved in this conflict."
The North attacked our cultural center last night.
"Believe me, we are doing everything we can to bring the people responsible to justice."
" ""The people responsible""?"
Who else would it be but the Northerners?
"Now, I know that when you're young, it's hard to keep perspective..."
 You're the one who's lost perspective.
"I'm trying to save my tribe, and you're taking pictures."
"Sending troops is not something I can do at this time, but I promise I will work with Unalaq and the South for a diplomatic solution."
"Now, I'm sorry, but my mind is made up."
This meeting is over.
" My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on your head for doing nothing about it."
I can't believe the President is doing nothing.
He... he doesn't even care.
"I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them."
 How could you take his side?
 What's with you and sides?
Why do you always think
I'm working against you?
" Well, you're not helping me."
I'm trying to get troops to the South.
What are you doing?
 I'm doing my job.
"Well, excuse me, Officer."
Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets.
I'm just trying to save the world.
"Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up."
I can't talk to you when you're like this.
You're the one who's like this!
"Hey, in a hurry?"
" Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick."
" Yeah, me too."
" Oh, hello."
See? I told you I could do it.
 Sorry I ever doubted you.
We can't wait for the President to act.
We need those troops now.
 And my company is about to go under.
I have to find a way to make some sales.
Right. Okay. Got it.
Idea storm.
Get the supplies.
"You're about to get an inside look at how Varrick Global Industries stays at the forefront of imagination innovation or ""imagivation""!"
"That's trademarked, pal."
Brain work requires increased circulation.
Let's do this!
"Okay, here come the ideas, fast and furious."
Pink mint lemon tea.
Radio for pets.
"Uh, hand shoes."
Hold on a tic.
We don't need the President to go to the South.
We just need the troops.
Let's go straight to them.
If there's one thing
"I know about troops, it's that they love fighting."
I know General Iroh.
He might be willing to help us.
A man on the inside. Perfect.
And you need to sell some mecha-tanks.
I know some people who need them.
We'll ship 'em South.
 That's perfect.
"You'll be making money for your company, and you'll be helping to defeat Unalaq."
 It's true.
"If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out cannot make money."
"It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are."
" It'll be crazy risky, but I love crazy risky!"
End storm!
"Zhu Li, get those other ideas to research and development."
I want prototypes by next week.
 I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South.
Don't worry.
I'm already working on that.
"As soon as people see this, they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq."
"Zhu Li, do the, uh... the thing."
Don't freak out. It's not real.
I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion.
Sorry. I keep doing that.
We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero battling the evil Unalaq.
No one will root for the North after they see
"""The Adventures of Nuktuk:"
"Hero of the South!"""
I'm Nuktuk! What do you think?
"Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today."
That guy is a genius.
 Uh-huh.
"He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha-tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing."
What? That's a terrible idea.
"And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk."
"He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold."
He was born in the tundra.
" Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here."
"Oh. Oh, sorry."
"Uh, sure. What is it?"
Something doesn't make sense about this bombing.
I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.
Wait a second! That's him!
That's the guy that attacked the center.
I gotta go show this to Beifong.
 Glad I could help.
Nuktuk saves the day again!
" All right, Meelo."
The first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish dominance.
You are in charge.
Never forget that.
Now call Poki.
" Poki, come here."
Poki.
"Poki, no."
 Meelo.
You're rewarding him for bad behavior.
 But he's tickling me.
You can't let him nap in the bed with you.
You are the alpha lemur.
He has to sleep on the floor.
"I know it's hard, but it's for the best."
"No, Poki. This is my bed."
You sleep on the floor.
Being alpha lemur is lonely.
 I know.
How did this cultural center attack happen right under your nose?
And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible?
" We're working on it, sir."
" Well, work harder."
"If you don't get any results soon,"
I'm going to find someone who can.
I got a break in the bombing case.
I I.D.'d the guy I saw at the scene.
" That's great, Mako."
"Yeah, you better run that in to Beifong right now."
 You think?
Sure. You're gonna be a hero.
 What makes a rookie beat cop think he can interrupt my meeting with the President?
I'm sorry.
"I just... um, I found something out about the bombing."
"Well, give it to Lu and Gang, you moron."
Now get out!
Sorry. Was she busy?
 This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions.
He's a member of the Agni Kais.
Someone must have hired him to make it look like Northerners attacked the cultural center.
 Hmm.
Did you learn anything about that remote control
I found at the scene?
That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.
"Listen, kid, it was the Northern Water Tribe, okay?"
" Yeah, give it a rest, super cop."
I've heard good things about you.
You've made some big triad busts for a rookie.
" Thank you, sir."
" And you're dating the Avatar, right?"
" Yes, sir."
I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick.
"You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City, would you, Officer?"
Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath.
You're a man of the law before anything else.
" Yes, sir."
" Well, keep up the good work."
Wait.
There's something you should know.
"Thank you for seeing me,"
General Iroh.
 What can I do?
" The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order."
So I decided to come to you directly.
 I see.
"Well, suppose I were to take the fleet south on some routine training maneuvers."
And let's say we were to accidentally run into a hostile Northern blockade.
"We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?"
I guess you wouldn't. Thank you.
 Swapping old war stories?
 Mr. President.
I hope you're not planning to take any military action without an order from your Commander in Chief.
" Of course not, sir."
" Good, because if a single vessel leaves this harbor without my say-so, you'll be court-martialed."
Am I clear?
" Crystal, sir."
Your activities here are bordering on insurrection.
The Avatar does not command the military of the Republic.
Don't go behind my back again.
"As you were, General Iroh."
 I hate that guy!
I'm sorry.
My hands are officially tied.
 I understand.
Thanks anyway.
 But you should talk to the Fire Lord.
My mother and grandfather have always been good friends to the Avatar and the Southern Water Tribe.
I'm sure they'll be willing to help.
" Thank you, General."
Wouldn't I be cold wearing this outfit in the snow?
" Ah, Nuktuk is never cold."
 Ooh.
"Hey, Ginger."
" How about that, huh?"
It's the latest product in my Varri-Manageable hair line:
Varri-dye!
"We get some shots of her using it before Unalaq kidnaps her,"
I guarantee we sell a million cases week one.
"Bolin, I need you to watch"
Naga while I'm gone.
 Where you going?
 The Fire Nation.
I'm going to try to get them to help the South.
I need a boat.
What happened with General Iroh?
"He was going to help, but then"
President Raiko showed up.
"Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out."
No one knew about it except for us and Asami.
 And Mako.
 Mako?
 What?
There's no way
Mako would have told.
Right?
" Poki, sit."
Roll over.
Good boy.
" Well done, Meelo."
I knew you could learn to train Poki.
 Not just Poki.
I trained all the lemurs.
Watch.
 I've created a monster.
"Uh, maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now."
Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?
" Thanks, Dad."
Training makes me tired.
"Come on, Poki."
 You ratted me out to the President?
" Korra, let me explain."
Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?
" Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question."
What was I supposed to do?
 You betrayed me and my family!
Enough!
"Look, I have a job to do."
I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another huge mistake.
" Well, I have a job to do too, only it seems like you're always standing in the way of me getting it done!"
"Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!"
 So what?
Are you breaking up with me?
Yeah. I guess I am.
 What the flamey-o happened here?
 I broke up with the Avatar.
 You got off easy.
You should have seen
Air Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me.
 You ruined my wedding!
No one steals my Bolin!
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Someone has attacked the Southern Water Tribe
Cultural Center.
"All the evidence points to Northern sympathizers, but Mako suspects there's more to this case."
"Meanwhile,"
Varrick has cast Bolin as the hero of his newest mover.
"Asami has also ventured into business with Varrick, and a shipment of her mecha-tanks is on its way to help the South in its war against Unalaq."
 We're under attack!
Varrick is not gonna be happy about this.
 Where is he?
Father said he would meet us at this location.
He'll be here.
Were you just in the spirit world?
Never mind that.
Where is the Avatar?
 She was within our grasp until a dark spirit attacked her.
 They're out of control.
 You didn't get her?
 The Avatar is dead.
 We finally made it.
Now we must stop the evil Unalaq!
The Southern Water Tribe is mine.
"Next, I will conquer the world with my waterbending doomsday device!"
"Don't worry, Juji and Roh-tan,"
I will end the evil Unalaq's reign of terror.
"For I am Nuktuk, hero of the South!"
"Nuktuk, you're not just the hero of the South, you're our best friend."
 Nuktuk-ity!
You two are the best snow raccoon and arctic panda a guy could ask for.
Who's gonna fight for friends and freedom?
Nuktuk
"He's the biggest, baddest"
Bendingest man I know
Who protects the icy tundra?
Nuktuk
Battling Northies out there in the snow
When Unalaq starts trouble
He'll punch him in the mouth
"He's Nuktuk, the hero of the South"
"Bolin, look up there."
What do you see?
 L... is this a trick question?
I'll tell you what I see... a star being born.
You're a star.
People love stars.
Stars tell them what to think and how to act.
"Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey-marmot to ride a bicycle?"
 Uh... not that I can recall.
 Of course you haven't.
You can't force monkey-marmots to do anything.
They've got to want to do it themselves.
 Right.
" With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the President to lend his troops to the war effort."
My evil plan is working.
I've captured
Nuktuk's beautiful girlfriend.
" Not so fast, evil Unalaq!"
"Oh, I will save my true love and the South!"
"And now, your time is up."
" It's no use fighting, Nuktuk."
My anti-energy net makes bending impossible.
 No! Please.
Power... weakening.
 Nuk-terrible.
Will this be the end of Nuktuk?
Can he escape from Unalaq's trap and save the beautiful Ginger?
"Find out next week on ""The Adventures of Nuktuk:"
"Hero of the South."""
Wow. We got some major chemistry on-screen.
Am I right?
 Yeah. On-screen.
What's wrong?
Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the evil Unalaq?
I'm gonna save you in the next episode.
"Ginger, let's work through this."
"Varrick, another one of your ships has been captured."
"Darn it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you"
I hate getting bad news without first getting good news?
" Oh, well, the good news is it looks like your first mover has gotten a great reception."
That's old news! Let's go.
 Is it true?
I'm so sorry.
Your entire shipment was stolen.
"Without that sale,"
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my company going.
What am I gonna do?
 Don't worry.
I'm gonna find whoever's responsible.
Chief Beifong is about to question the captain of the ship.
" I know it's been a long day, but walk me through what happened."
We were ambushed about
30 klicks outside the harbor.
We never heard them coming.
 This is the third attack this week.
At about the same location.
"Yep, and smack-dab in Republic City's jurisdiction, which means another problem for us."
All this stress is gonna turn old black beauty gray.
 It's gotta be Northern Water Tribe.
They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.
I agree. Is there anything else about the attack you remember?
Anything unusual?
 There is one thing.
The bombs exploded in a way
I've never seen before.
They didn't have fuses.
It was like they were being detonated remotely.
 Like the bombs at the cultural center.
" Wait, where are you going?"
 I gotta grab some evidence.
" Asami, I heard the news."
I can't believe they took my fifth favorite ship in the Varrick Industries fleet!
Named her after my mom.
"Rest in peace, Rocky Bottom."
" Without the money from that shipment,"
Future Industries is almost broke.
"Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the Cultural Center."
 What do you think you're doing?
 Solving this case.
Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand?
I think it's a remote detonator.
 It was too dark to see anything.
 Mako!
"Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe."
Of course they were
Northern Water Tribe.
They were waterbending.
Was this one of the guys who attacked?
" No, I don't recognize him."
" Oh, that's embarrassing."
"Nice try, rookie."
" Mako, leave. Now."
" Great work, everybody."
Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!
"Wait, I think Mako might be onto something."
" Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys."
" Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie."
 He's doing a better job than you.
 Who's hungry?
Enough!
I don't want to hear your lame-brained rookie ideas.
"You're a beat cop, not a detective."
Now hit the street and do your job!
 Lu and Gang are idiots.
I hate them and their stupid mustaches.
Forget them.
What's this idea of yours?
 A sting operation.
"I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it."
 Let's do it.
 It's not that easy.
"For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no."
"We can make it work, just the two of us."
 I don't know.
I don't want to go behind Beifong's back.
"If she finds out,"
I could get kicked off the force.
" Mako, I need your help."
My mom is gone.
My dad is in jail.
Future Industries is all
I have left of my family.
" I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job."
"First of all, we'd need a ship."
 You need a ship? I got a ship.
I want in on whatever you're talking about.
I love being in on plans.
" The less you know, the better."
Perfect!
I love not knowing things.
"All right, I'm in."
Let's get these guys.
The ship's all loaded with the dummy crates.
Let's get this sting operation going.
Not yet.
We need some extra manpower.
 What about Korra?
No better muscle than the Avatar.
" Right, uh... Korra."
"Yeah, actually, she's, um... she's out of town right now."
 Everything okay with you two?
"Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra."
I'll go talk to Bolin.
" Hey, Mako, what do you think?"
I did a little redecorating.
It turns out that one of the perks of being a star... you get lots of cash.
 Is this a marble statue of you?
 It's also a hat rack.
 We don't even have hats.
That's because we've never had a hat rack.
And now we do.
"Mako, you seem stressed."
I think you need to take a little dipity dip.
"I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay?"
"I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help."
 You need my help?
I don't know. I'm kinda busy.
 You're sitting in a hot tub.
 I'm maintaining my instrument.
"As an actor, my body is my instrument."
 Are you gonna help or not?
" You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life."
 So that's a no.
What am I supposed to do now?
" I don't know, Mako."
Figure it out. Remember?
That's what you said to me.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
Ow! My instrument!
 Are you sure this is a good idea?
" No, but it's our last resort."
"Hey, Mako."
"Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it."
 I'm not here on police business.
"I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action."
 How big a piece?
"So, Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh?"
What's in it for the Triple Threats?
I am personal friends with the Avatar.
I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.
" Sounds good to me, boss."
 What about the rest of us?
" I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line."
They can be yours if you help.
 I think we got ourselves a deal.
This is right around the area where the attacks happened.
"So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet."
"I agree. Keep quiet, mouth zipped, don't say a word."
"That's the best thing to do when you're trying to ambush somebody, which is what we're doing here, and it's basically what I'm always doing."
"I mean, I am a gangster, after all, and..."
" Two Toed Ping, please."
" Oh, right."
So what's it like dating the Avatar?
"Come on, Mako, I gotta know."
" Ping, stay focused!"
What?
Why are you so weird about it?
"If I was dating the Avatar,"
I'd tell you all about it.
 There's nothing to know.
I broke up with her.
 You broke up?
When? Why didn't you tell me?
 I don't know.
"Yeah, right."
You broke up with the Avatar.
Like that happened.
"Hey, Shady Shin, Viper."
Mako says he broke up with the Avatar.
 Sure he did.
" Yeah, I did too."
"All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?"
 And action!
 Forget about me.
You must capture the evil Unalaq before he gets away.
No! I'll never leave you.
'Mm!
 Cut!
There's no kiss in the script.
"Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment."
It just felt so right.
 Ugh!
"It did, huh?"
"Your girlfriend's about to die, and instead of untying her, you kiss her."
Wait a minute!
Maybe that will work.
Yes! It's genius!
Everybody take five.
"Except for you, Zhu Li."
Grab the tweezers.
I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.
"So... that kiss... I liked it, and it seemed like you liked it too."
 Ugh!
You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character.
" Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now."
"It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not."
That's because
"Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin."
 But Nuktuk is Bolin.
I'm a hero.
And that's why they call me
Two Toed Ping.
 Because you have two extra toes.
 That's right... and there was already a Twelve Toed Ping on the south side.
"Wait, guys. Do you hear that?"
 I didn't hear anything.
 No.
 Ah! What's taking so long?
" You just gotta relax, like me."
Maybe try taking your shoes off.
 I'm gonna check it out.
So how long do we have to stay out here?
"I told you, it's gonna be a few hours."
"What, do you have a hot date?"
"Actually, I do, and I wanna look my best."
I gotta shower and shave.
"I have a whole routine, okay?"
" Well, your date's gonna have to wait."
She's not gonna be happy about that.
 Too bad.
"We were paid to keep Mako and that dame distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do."
" See, this is why I never get dates."
 I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper.
We've been double-crossed.
We have to get off this ship.
 Where do you think you're going?
 Get 'em!
They're getting closer.
 Not for long.
Watch out!
We're not gonna make it.
" One down, one to go."
 We're stalled.
" Mako, hang onto something."
 What was that all about?
Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted.
 Distracted? From what?
"Oh, no."
Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.
 I'm ruined.
 My company... it's over.
We should check out your other warehouses.
Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.
 You don't understand.
Everything I had was in here.
We have to search the place for evidence.
If we can find a lead...
Mako... it doesn't matter anymore.
 I can figure this out.
 Just stop. It's over.
<i>L</i> give UP
" Well, I'm not giving up on you."
" Sorry, I..."
 Uh... it's... it's okay.
Um... anyway...
I gotta run.
"I'm gonna find out who did this, and I know just who to ask."
" Hey, Mako."
"Uh, you're not mad about last night, are you?"
 Who hired you to double-cross us?
 I don't know.
 I think you do know.
"And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to ""No Toed Ping."""
"Really, I don't know."
You have to believe me.
We never met the guy who hired us.
You expect me to believe that?
"After you left the hideout, some mook showed up and said his boss would pay us to keep you distracted."
"We'd never seen him before, and we ain't seen him since."
"Come on, Mako, you know how these deals work."
Please. I would never lie to you with my lucky toes on the line.
 Get out of here.
" Bolin, have you seen Varrick around?"
Bolin!
Nuktuk.
"Yes? Oh, hello, Mako."
Didn't notice you there.
Where's Varrick?
I need to ask him something.
" Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him, but I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene."
"There's gonna be some crazy ""pyrotechnics."""
That's mover speak for explosions.
We need Nuktuk on set.
Running explosion scene.
Or sometimes we just call them explosions.
"Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene."
" Okay, the set is clear."
Camera's rolling.
And... action!
"Ginger, stay down!"
I'm coming for you.
 How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?
" Neat, huh?"
It's a Varrick Industries exclusive.
"Here, check it out."
The explosions use a remote detonator.
 Varrick.
"Asami, I think I know who set us up."
" Hello, Mako."
 What are you doing here?
 He just saved my company.
Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries.
Isn't that great?
" Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy, especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy."
" So what were you saying, Mako?"
You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?
"Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it."
I'll fill you in later.
Get away from me!
"It's okay, we're here to help you, Avatar Korra."
 Who's...
Who's Avatar Korra?
 What happened to you?
How did you end up on our island?
 I... don't know.
I can't remember anything.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
The Avatar has gone missing.
"After President Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the War of the Water Tribes, she headed to the Fire Nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq."
"But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean."
She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.
"We found the Avatar washed up onshore, but she doesn't remember anything."
Raava.
Raava. Raava.
 A dark energy has infected her.
We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar spirit.
Let the waters cleanse the darkness that plagues your spirit.
 Who are you?
 I am you.
 Who am I?
 You are the Avatar.
 I don't know what that is.
" In order to remember, you must regain your connection with your Avatar spirit."
"If you don't, darkness will engulf the world."
"You will die, and our era will end."
 How do I regain my connection?
Go back.
Return to the beginning.
Find Raava.
 Are you Raava?
" No, but I can help you find her."
"My name is Wan, and I will show you how I became the first Avatar."
 Nobody steals from the Chou brothers!
Really? Because I just did.
" You're dead, Wan."
" Actually, I feel quite alive."
" Hey, stop!"
"Hey, fellas."
You're just in time for lunch!
 I told you no one steals from us.
Did you steal from the Chous again?
"Yeah, and I got nothing to show for it except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises."
"Hey, Yao, I got some food for you."
Mmm. Delicious.
"Thank you, Wan."
" You guys are hungry too, huh?"
" Wan, you should eat."
They need it more than I do.
"Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps."
If only there was some way to get into the Chous' food cellar.
"We'd be eating like... well, like Chous."
"If Chou the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace, you'll end up dead."
"Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds."
" No, don't get banished."
You don't want nothing to do with those spirits.
"They'll get inside ya, scramble up your mind, turn ya into this... a monster!"
" Don't do anything crazy, Wan."
You just gotta accept the world is the way it is.
Some people have power.
Some people don't.
And you don't.
"Not yet, anyway."
Are you strong?
Are you fearless?
Do you have what it takes to battle the spirits?
Then join the hunt.
 Count me in.
We're going to be out in the wilds for a week.
You wouldn't last two seconds.
 I can handle myself.
"We all get fire, right?"
" Yeah, but do you know how to use it?"
" Well, not exactly, but I..."
" Ah, let him come."
Not like we got any other volunteers lining up.
All right. Welcome to the hunt.
 The lion turtle.
" Great guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people."
"Please, grant us the power of fire."
 The power is yours to keep until your return.
" You're first, kid."
 May the element of fire protect you against the spirits.
Whoa!
"Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay?"
 Sure thing.
 Everyone stay close.
Spirits love to pick off stragglers.
" Uh, guys?"
I don't think I can do this.
" Now, quit your whining."
We haven't even seen a spirit yet.
 I think I wanna go home.
I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward.
"Go give your fire back to the lion turtle, and don't ever show your face around me again."
" Wan, you're back."
What goodies did you snatch for us this time?
 What did you do?
You can't steal from the lion turtle.
Really? Because I just did.
 You know it's forbidden to bring the power of the element into the city.
"Please, go back to the lion turtle and return the fire."
"Jaya, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous and show them we have the power to change things."
"Hey, Chous!"
"Open the gate, and let us in."
What are those filthy peasants doing here?
"Don't worry, father."
We'll take care of them.
"Hand over all the food you're hoarding, and we won't give you any trouble."
 You're not getting past us.
We have the weapons.
You're powerless.
" Powerless, huh?"
Follow me!
Grab as much food as you can.
 Maybe you're right.
Maybe we do have the power to change things.
 Stop right there!
 Looks like the Chous found backup.
 Get everyone out of here.
I'll hold them off.
"No, please. Have mercy."
Wan?
"Even when you have the power, you're afraid to use it."
"Tell me who else was involved in the rebellion, and I might take mercy on you."
 I'm not telling you anything.
" Then, you've left me no choice."
"Wan, you are hereby banished."
Yeah! And give back the fire you stole.
No! Wait.
"Great lion turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment."
"But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds."
 Never again may you return to this city.
But I will allow you to keep the power of the element.
 Bet he doesn't last till morning.
"Hey, watch where you're stepping, human!"
 Who said that?
 Down here!
How'd you like it if I started walking all over you?
You're just a little frog.
Who's little now?
Get off me! Get off me!
"You are not welcome in my oasis, human."
" Please, help me."
"I'm starving, and I haven't slept all night."
 Not my problem.
 Let me pass.
 You dare use fire against me?
"Now, be gone with you!"
 And who might you be?
" I am Bushy, the bush spirit."
And I would like to enter your oasis.
Very well. You may pass.
Wait a second!
Something stinks.
I knew I smelled a human!
"Come on, let me in, just for a little while."
No! Go back to your lion turtle.
"Believe me,"
I'd love to go back home.
But I can't. I was kicked out.
 That's too bad.
 Poor human.
 Don't pity him.
"He's just like every other human: ugly, destructive, and lacking any respect for nature."
" Who are you calling ugly, ugly?"
" If you can't go back to your city, then you should go live in another one."
What?
There are other lion turtles?
"""There are other lion turtles?"""
"Of course there are, dozens of them!"
"Boy, you humans are stupid too."
So which way to the nearest lion turtle city?
I think it's on the other side of None-of-Your-Business Valley.
 Real funny.
You know what?
I don't need your help.
I'll find it myself.
 Good luck!
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of there.
" Finally, we caught something."
Get it down.
 Back off.
Wan? What are you doing here?
 I'm saving this animal.
 That animal's our dinner.
"Now, get out of the way."
 No.
 Ahh!
He... help! Help!
Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
Ahh!
"Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan."
 I really hate humans!
"No, no."
I don't know what he's screaming about.
He's better-looking now.
I feel great.
What's in this water?
 It has special healing properties.
 Thanks.
So what did you do to that hunter?
 Spirits are able to take over a human body for a short time.
"If I stayed in there any longer,"
"I would've killed him, which I did consider."
 Thanks for saving my neck.
But Why'd you do it?
I saw you save the cat-deer from those hunters.
I've never seen such an act of selflessness from a human before.
Told you
I wasn't like the others.
" Guess I underestimated you, human."
Are you off to find another lion turtle city?
 I was.
But I think I've had enough of humans for a while.
I've decided to stay here and learn the ways of the spirits.
 What a great idea.
 That'll be fun.
" Oh, now, now, hold on."
A human living with spirits?
It's never been done.
" First time for everything, right?"
I guess we can try it.
I've never had a human as a pet before.
"I think I'll call you ""Stinky."""
 The name is Wan.
 Stinky is more accurate.
 What happened in the wilds?
Where are the others?
Gone. Spirits took them.
They were protecting that kid Wan like he was one of their own.
Did you hear that?
Wan's still alive.
" And the way Wan moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen."
He uses it like it's an extension of his body.
"Wan has proven that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds."
"We don't have to live under Chou the elder's rules anymore, so I say we leave this city and start over."
Who's with me?
" You ready to go, Mula?"
 You sure you want to leave?
"Yes, it's time I see the rest of the world and find the other lion turtle cities."
"I'm proud to call you my friend, Stinky."
Thank you for everything.
"Good-bye, everyone."
 We'll miss you.
 The all-powerful spirits are battling.
They're gonna wipe out the entire valley!
" Stop, or you'll destroy everything!"
" This doesn't concern you, human!"
 It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger.
" If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free."
Don't involve the human.
This is between us.
" Please, save me."
"She has tormented me for 10,000 years."
" 10,000 years?"
Let him go!
" Thank you, human."
You have performed a great service for the spirits.
 Do you realize what you've done?
"Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you."
 You are gravely mistaken.
I was keeping him under control.
 And what gives you the right?
" You don't even know who I am, do you?"
 Should I?
 Yes.
My name is Raava.
That spirit you freed is Vaatu.
He is the force of darkness and chaos.
I am the force of light and peace.
"Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world."
"And for the past 10,000 years,"
"I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance, until you came along."
" So by freeing Vaatu,"
I let chaos into the world?
 Precisely.
"The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation, and it's all your fault."
" Raava, I found you."
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
 Should we pull her up?
 No.
She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories.
She must confront her own past if she is to move forward.
We can only hope that she survives her ordeal.
"The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation, and it's all your fault."
This is why humans have no place interfering in the business of spirits.
" This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business."
" Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist!"
I only hope I can track down Vaatu before it's too late.
 Let me help you.
 I don't want your help.
"Don't interfere with me again, human!"
 Let's get moving.
"Do you see that, Mula?"
People.
And they have some kind of wind power.
More humans!
I found you.
 Aah!
 Wait! I'm friendly!
Huh?
The legends are true.
"Another lion turtle city, and it's flying."
I have got to get over there.
There.
"Okay, Mula."
Wish me luck.
"Oh, no..."
Wow.
"Hi, how are you?"
I'm Wan.
"I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans."
" Where did you come from, stranger?"
 Another lion turtle city far away.
For the past two years
I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.
Remarkable. Come. Sit with us.
We would love to hear of your travels.
 Vaatu.
" So we meet again, human."
Why is the great spirit of darkness here but not his other half?
" Uh, I'll explain later."
Leave these people in peace.
They've done nothing to harm you.
 Be gone.
"How are you feeling since our split, Raava?"
I've never been better.
"When harmonic convergence comes,"
I will destroy you forever.
I told you not to interfere.
 I had to do something.
These people were in danger.
" Great spirit of light, we thank you for your help."
But how did you become split from Vaatu?
 Ask him.
 It wasn't my fault.
Vaatu tricked me into freeing him.
I'd take it all back if I could.
 It's too late for that.
"Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark."
"The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes."
" He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller."
"As darkness grows, light fades."
"I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right."
 How?
" Great lion turtle,"
I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late.
 You already carry the power of fire.
No human has ever held two elements at the same time.
 I'm not like other humans.
I can learn to do it.
" Hmm, perhaps."
"But to do so,"
Raava must hold the power for you until you master it.
"Ancient one, why would I do that for a human?"
Especially one who's caused so much trouble?
"Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake."
"Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance."
 You may be right.
Very well.
I will help you to master the power of air.
Thank you.
And in return I will help you restore balance to the world.
What's this harmonic thing
Vaatu was talking about?
 Harmonic convergence.
That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.
 How long do we have until then?
 About a year in your time.
 Then we better start training.
"All right, I'm ready to try air."
How's this gonna work?
 The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies.
Great.
So you've done this before.
No. This has never even been attempted.
It is very dangerous.
"That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that."
I'm ready. Give me the air.
It feels completely different.
"If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?"
 He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness.
One cannot exist without the other.
"Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again."
The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me.
 That doesn't sound so bad.
"Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back."
"Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it."
Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it.
"Darkness will cover the earth for 10,000 years."
" If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu, then I should visit more lion turtles."
Why is there so much conflict between humans and spirits in the first place?
This physical world is where humans come from.
Spirits come from another realm.
"At the north and south poles, the two realms intersect."
"Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world."
"Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them and losing touch with each other."
Most people think they live in the only human city in the world.
"Most humans think only of themselves, no matter how many others are around."
" When you pass through me,"
I feel an incredible rush of power.
I feel like I'm changing.
"The more we practice, the stronger I become."
Smells like smoke.
 Humans are nearby.
 Let's check it out.
<i>'</i> A Spirit!
"Easy there, fellas."
We're friendly.
 I can't believe it. Wan?
Jaya!
What are you doing out here?
Ha ha! You inspired us.
"Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too."
Where's Yao?
Did he come with you?
" Yes, but sadly he didn't make it."
We... we lost a lot of good men along the way.
So why were you protecting this spirit?
This is Raava. Don't worry.
She's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.
 Dark spirits?
What's the difference?
We throw fire at any spirit we see around here.
Just like they attack any man.
 You have no idea what you're doing!
You're only making things worse.
 The spirits are coming back!
 Let's wipe 'em out this time.
We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to.
 What happened to you?
When did you become so violent?
You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid.
Now we're doing it.
 This isn't what I had in mind.
" Get out of the forest, humans."
 Wait.
We can resolve this peacefully.
Stinky? You came back.
 It's good to see you again.
You and Raava are just in time to help us clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here just like the old days.
You're the one who's getting cleared out.
 There's no need for violence.
I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.
" You have a good heart, Stinky, but these fire tossers aren't like you."
 Spirits like him killed our friends.
I can't let them get away with that.
 We are protectors of the forest.
We won't let you burn it down.
It's Vaatu.
"He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side."
 Wipe them out!
" Stop, please!"
"Raava, we need to combine our energies."
Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this.
Enough!
You need to stop fighting now before you destroy each other.
"Stinky, w-what happened?"
 He's controlling all four elements.
"Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you."
No. It's working.
"If you leave, the fighting will start again."
 Wan!
We have to go back.
 Don't bother.
Your human friends have already been annihilated.
 No!
 Enjoy your final days.
See you at the end of the world.
 Raava.
" I'm sorry, Wan."
 We're almost there.
"I was wrong about you, Wan."
I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage.
I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together.
Let's not give up before the battle's even begun.
Who knows what will happen?
"After all, this is my first harmonic convergence."
This is the southern portal to the spirit world.
Here Vaatu and I will do battle once again at the place where the two worlds meet.
"Are you ready for our final battle, Raava?"
"Thanks to our friend separating us,"
I think this time
I may be rid of you once and for all.
"Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me."
 No human can stand against me.
 Haven't you heard the legends?
I'm not a regular human anymore.
Uhh!
" I lived 10,000 lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud."
 Aah!
Oof... oh!
It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world!
 To hate me is to give me breath.
To fight me is to give me strength.
Now prepare to face oblivion!
Raava!
The only way to win is together.
Ah!
Aah!
I have to leave you.
"If I stay any longer, you will die."
 It doesn't matter.
"If you leave me now,"
Vaatu will destroy everything.
We have to finish this together!
The harmonic convergence is about to begin.
The era of Raava is over.
 Aah!
We are bonded forever.
 This is your prison now.
And I will close the portal so no human will ever be able to physically enter the spirit world and release you.
The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the spirit world.
I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained.
I will be the bridge between our two worlds.
The world is entering a new age.
Our time protecting mankind is over.
We will no longer give humans the power of the elements.
Different groups of people must learn to live together.
This is my mission... to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace.
" I'm sorry, Raava."
I failed to bring peace.
"Even with Vaatu locked away, darkness still surrounds humanity."
There wasn't enough time.
Don't worry.
We will be together for all of your lifetimes.
And we will never give up.
I remember.
 Do you know who you are?
 My name is Korra.
I'm the Avatar.
We've been raising this herd of air bison since the Hundred Year War.
I never thought I'd be able to present one to the Avatar.
Thank you for all your kindness.
I wonder how long
I've been away.
" That I cannot say, but you do not have much time left."
The harmonic convergence is only weeks away.
 I have to close the spirit portal before that happens.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Korra has regained her memory!
"By connecting with the original Avatar,"
"Korra learned that to stop Unalaq she must close the spirit portal before harmonic convergence, which is only weeks away!"
"Meanwhile, Varrick has made"
Bolin into a mover star and saved Asami's company.
"Mako is the only one who suspects that Varrick is up to no good, but can he prove it?"
 Gotcha!
"Furry-Foot, come back."
" Jinora, there you are."
"Come on, everyone's waiting."
Were you playing with someone?
" Oh, just some imaginary friends."
 Stop telling lies.
 It's true!
I once beat an Earthbender in a rock-throwing contest!
I have the trophy to prove it.
"All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple?"
"We've got a lot to see today including ancient statues, ancient gardens, and the meditation hall used by ancient Airbenders."
. Yay
Old things.
 Korra?
Korra!
"Yay, Korra."
 Korra's back.
 What are you doing here?
And how did you know where to find us?
 Tenzin's itinerary.
We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.
See? This is why schedules are important.
It's so great to see you all again.
" It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?"
"Wait, you don't know about the civil war?"
 What? No.
We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation.
 Tenzin's idea.
What happened?
 So much.
I don't know where to start.
 Just tell us everything!
 Everything?
Okay.
"I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be a bad guy and wanted to take control of the South, so I sort of started a civil war, but when I went to find some help,"
"I was attacked by my cousins and then by a giant, dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized"
"I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!"
 I knew this would happen.
So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the spirit world?
"Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him."
" I knew Unalaq was hungry for power, but never realized how far he would go to get it."
 This is all my fault.
" No, don't blame yourself."
This is Unalaq's doing.
"Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage."
 Thank you.
"So you need to close the southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?"
 I thought about that.
My best chance to close the portal is from the inside.
I have to enter the spirit world.
 A journey to the spirit world.
All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment.
I will help you.
"Today, we enter the spirit world."
" Father, what are we doing here?"
You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.
" I told you, it wasn't our fault."
 You're right.
It was my fault for trusting you.
Harmonic convergence is almost upon us.
This is my opportunity to change the world.
" We'll make it up to you, Father."
" Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal."
I thought only the Avatar could do it.
 I believe there is another way.
This way.
There it is: the northern portal.
 Cut!
"Okay, that's lunch, everyone."
Hello? Anyone?
"Nuktuk's still up here, all alone."
Asami!
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming.
Are you filming right now?
"Right now? Nope. We're, uh... we're at lunch."
"Asami, there you are."
Is Bolin around?
 Up here.
 Good.
I've got something to tell you both.
Ow.
I got to stop doing my own stunts.
I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries:
Varrick.
 What? No.
 He attacked his own ship?
 Yes! It was a ploy.
"He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it."
He already had all the shipping.
All he needed was Future Industries.
 Varrick helped save Future Industries.
"He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind."
"Mako, you seem stressed."
 I am stressed!
" See, this is why I had to move out."
You guys aren't living together anymore?
Nope.
It was time for this eagle-hawk to spread his wings and fly.
Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week.
Maybe you just need to relax.
 Wait a minute.
Are you two... you're dating again! What?
 Dating? No!
 That's crazy!
 Korra just left a week ago!
" Guys, listen to me."
"Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof."
The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the Cultural Center attack.
And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when
Asami's shipment was hijacked.
Don't you see?
 Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.
" Yeah. Let it go, Mako."
Let it go.
 No! I'm not going to let it go!
 Varrick's been looking for you.
 You're lucky.
This temple is the most spiritual of all the Air Temples.
"Why, this very garden is where my father met Guru Pathik."
 Wow!
"Spirit world, here we come."
 Are you in the spirit world?
I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.
" Aww, did I do it wrong?"
 Let's try something else.
I thought your bell ringing was just fine.
 Thanks!
"Kya, this is too much smoke."
You set it up wrong.
This isn't going to work.
I'm sorry.
I did what you told me.
" Well, the moment's ruined."
 We could have tried a little longer.
" Come back, Furry-Foot!"
"Hey, Jinora, what are you chasing?"
 Nothing.
" Focus, Korra."
Focus.
 I am focusing.
 No talking.
Feel the energy of the universe.
" Okay, I feel it."
" Korra, really!"
I'm trying to concentrate here!
I don't think this location is going to work either.
 What's going on with you?
"First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me."
" Well, nothing is feeling right to me."
" I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry."
How did you first get into the spirit world?
Let's try that.
" Well... actually, I've never been into the spirit world."
You've never been into the spirit world?
But you used to spend days in the temple meditating.
 Trying to get in.
It never happened.
"It's my greatest shortcoming as an Airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang."
"Welcome to the ""I Disappoint Dad"" Club."
"If you've never been to the spirit world, how were you planning to get Korra into it?"
I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders.
"Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time."
"Tenzin, harmonic convergence is almost here."
If Vaatu escapes from the spirit world...
 You have to trust me.
I can help you.
 There might be another way.
"Jinora, is there something you want to tell Korra?"
 Jinora?
She is too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.
"Actually, I think I do know where Korra needs to go to get into the spirit world."
 And how would you know that?
 My spirit friends showed me.
It's okay.
You can show yourselves.
 How did you do that?
 Jinora.
 Bunnies!
"Actually, they're dragonfly-bunny spirits."
 I knew it.
Looks like she does know something about spiritual matters.
 So cute.
 Bunnies!
Come back!
How long have you been able to do this?
 I don't know.
I guess I've always kind of had a connection with spirits.
I think this one likes me.
 Are they here to help?
I think they want you to go down there.
 I don't know.
The spiritual energy is historically strongest near the temple.
"No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the spirit world, so I'm gonna follow them."
" If we need to go to the Tenzin world, we'll call you."
"Father, haven't the spirits had 10,000 years to open this portal?"
" If they could not succeed, what makes you think we will?"
"By entering the spirit world through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending."
Join me!
Together we can open this portal.
 Desna!
 Leave him.
Keep bending!
 He needs a healer at once!
 This is more important!
 I'm taking him back.
 I hear you've got some ideas.
You wanna tell me about them?
 Go ahead.
Torture me all you want.
I'm not gonna talk.
 Torture?
The only thing I want to torture is this pesky foot fungus.
Doh! Ah!
Eee! Ooh!
The burning means it's working.
"I heard you've been investigating the recent attacks on my ships, and I think you know that I know that you know, you know?"
 Know what?
" That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why"
I want to offer you a job on my security force.
 I have a job.
 We need you.
"Me, Asami, Bolin."
We're all on the same team here.
We want you to join us.
"You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you?"
"I mean, I heard you and her were kind of an item again."
Or what about your brother?
 What are you saying?
I'm saying I want your help to protect them.
"Without you, who knows what could happen."
" Thanks for your concern, but the answer is no."
" Oh, you are just so cute."
I'm going to name you Bum-Ju.
"It's short for ""Bumi, Junior."""
Don't you think he looks like me?
 The resemblance is uncanny.
 I think Dad's mad at me.
 Your father's not mad.
His pride's just a little bruised since he isn't able to see spirits like you.
 You have a natural gift.
That's pretty lucky.
 You're the lucky one.
You actually got to meet the first Avatar.
"I know about a lot of Avatars, but I don't know anything about him."
"Is it even a him, or is it a her?"
" It's a him, Avatar Wan."
He was amazing.
"I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the spirit of light."
 The Avatar is part spirit?
Of course!
Just like the statue!
 What statue?
"When we were at the Southern Air Temple,"
I was drawn to this old carving.
I couldn't figure out what it was until now.
It was the first Avatar.
 When did this happen?
 It was on the solstice.
That's the day
I opened the southern portal.
 Whoa.
 We're here!
 Are you sure these spirits are leading us to the right place?
 Of course!
I trust Bum-Ju with my life.
 Look.
There are carvings on them.
This is an ancient Airbender meditation circle.
"There's a lot of spiritual energy in this place, but it feels really strange."
We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.
 What are you talking about?
 Dad taught it to me.
This site has been neglected for many years.
A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connection to the spirit world.
"Good job, you cleansed the area of the only spirits that want to help us, and you scared away Bum-Ju."
 It's working.
Ah! Bats!
Evil bats!
 Not bats.
Dark spirits!
 What are we supposed to do?
 Amazing.
Your spiritual training has come a long way.
" Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke."
He taught you how to transform dark spirits.
I can't even get you into the spirit world.
Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself.
Everything you've done was meant to help me.
I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor.
I need you now more than ever.
 I won't let you down.
The ancient Airbenders must have built this site.
"If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the spirit world."
 Why don't you go first?
" After all these years, my father's dream for me will finally come true."
 Hi.
 Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?
 No.
I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay.
You seemed so agitated earlier.
 I'm fine.
 Maybe you need a night off.
Why don't we go get some dinner?
" No, thanks."
I'm a little busy.
 Too busy for Kwong's Cuisine?
Remember?
We had our first date there.
Maybe I do need to get my mind off things.
 Police!
"Hey, Mako."
Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds.
 What's going on?
 We busted some Triple Threats who said you hired them for a job.
 All right. It's true.
"We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation."
I'm sorry for going behind your back.
"According to the Triple Threats, you did more than that."
They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property.
 That's crazy!
You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?
 I have to follow up on a lead.
" Well, looky what I found: cash“."
And these.
"What are you doing with explosives, Mako?"
I don't know where those came from.
 You're under arrest.
 None of that is mine.
Should've known you'd hook up with your old pals.
"Once a Triple Threat, always a Triple Threat."
 This has to be a mistake.
"Sorry to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop."
That sting operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse.
He was using you the whole time.
" That's not true, Asami."
I would never do anything to hurt you.
It's Varrick.
This is all Varrick.
He set me up!
" Yeah, it's Varrick's fault."
Varrick.
Varrick.
 You in the spirit world yet?
" No, I am not, and stop bugging me"
" It's okay, Tenzin."
Maybe you weren't meant to guide Korra into the spirit world.
No! Just give me some time.
 Stop being so stubborn.
It's not your destiny.
I think Jinora was meant to guide the Avatar.
Jinora will not enter the spirit world!
"She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but I am."
"I've spent years training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the spirit world."
" Tenzin, we're running out of time."
 If everyone could just be quiet and let me focus.
 Aunt Kya is right.
I can guide Korra into the spirit world.
I'll be all right.
Perhaps I will never have the connection with spirits like I always wanted... like my father wanted me to have.
" It's okay, Daddy."
 I'm proud of you.
Go. Close the portal.
We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.
 We'll be all right.
The spirit world.
" The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the northern portal."
"I have failed you, Vaatu."
 You have not failed me...
<i>Yet.</i>
The Avatar still lives.
 How do you know?
"Even though my connection to Raava was severed,"
I can still feel her presence.
 I'll find her.
 The Avatar will find you.
She has just entered the spirit world.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
<i>T.</i>
Korra and Jinora have entered the spirit world.
"With Tenzin's daughter as her spiritual guide, the Avatar has one mission: to close the spirit portal before harmonic convergence."
"Meanwhile,"
"Unalaq has been working with the dark spirit Vaatu, who was imprisoned by Avatar Wan 10,000 years ago."
Will Korra be able to close the portal and stop Unalaq from enacting his deadly plan?
<i>T.</i>
 I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the spirit world instead of me.
"If anything happens to her,"
I won't be able to forgive myself.
" She's very smart, and she obviously has a strong connection to the spirits."
She'll be fine.
" Yeah, Dad went all the time."
They won't have their bending in there.
They'll be defenseless.
"Excuse me, but I've never had bending, and I don't think"
"I'd call myself ""defenseless."""
" Of course you aren't, because you have your, um..."
 Positive attitude?
" I would have said acute intellect and catlike reflexes, but whatever."
 Why don't you two get some sleep?
I'll take the first watch.
 Wake us up if you need some company.
"Or if any interesting spirity stuff happens, like their bodies start floating around and you need someone to help you grab them before they fly off."
 Bumi.
I'm just saying we're here if you need us.
I know you are. Thank you.
Please come back soon.
 Isn't it beautiful?
" Just stick close to me, okay?"
"This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits."
Huh.
Look.
It's like it's made of jewels.
The spirits are so much more beautiful in their own world than they are at home.
" Jinora, be careful."
Hold on.
Hey.
"Watch where you're goin', you giant clod."
 Sorry.
" This is a residential area, in case you hadn't noticed."
"Who do you think you are, stomping through here like that?"
 I'm the Avatar.
 The Avatar.
Not impressed.
 I'm trying to find the spirit portals?
I opened one...
 I heard Unalaq did that.
" No, I did, but..."
"Well, if you opened it, how come you don't know where it is, huh?"
B-b-because I was at the South Pole.
 I don't trust her.
 Get out of our world.
 We don't need you.
 You don't belong here.
 Get away from me.
 Did you guys see that?
She tried to bend at us in our own holes.
Get her!
Jinora!
 Korra! Stay calm.
Your energy is upsetting them.
You're only making it worse.
<i>T.</i>
 Jinora!
Jinora?
Jinora.
Ah.
Jinora.
Jinora.
Korra! Where are you?
Hello? I'm lost.
Can anyone help me?
"Furry-Foot, is that you?"
It's so good to see you again.
You're so big here.
"I don't suppose you know where Korra is, do you?"
"We were supposed to go find the spirit portals, but I don't know how to find anything down here."
It's like an awesome tree house.
"Wait, I've read about this place."
Grandpa Aang came here.
It's Wan Shi Tang's spirit library.
"""Ah! Get away!"
I'm sorry I swatted you.
You just scared me.
 You two look lost.
Maybe I can help you.
 I know you.
 I was good friends with Avatar Aang.
 Iroh.
" Hello, Korra."
" I'm glad you came to visit us in the spirit world, Korra."
You came just in time.
We're having a little tea party to celebrate May-Jim's wedding.
 How can you marry each other?
Aren't you...
Complete opposites? I know.
" I tried to fight it, but she really grew on me."
" The spirit world is very mysterious, but so is love."
Help yourself to some tea and cakes.
"They are spirit cakes, so you won't gain any weight."
"Of course, you won't lose any, either."
This part of the spirit world isn't so scary.
My teapot.
That's right.
"It was yours long, long ago."
"When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the light spirit Raava around until the two of you became one."
It's my favorite thing I've found here.
"You know, when you make tea in it, you can still taste a little light in every cup."
<i>T.</i>
 Wow.
"I could just stay in here forever, reading."
The last human who said that is still here.
 Professor Zei.
"I see that you have some knowledge of the past, so you should know that humans are no longer allowed in my library."
Get out.
 I thought anyone could come in if they brought you some new knowledge.
 Those are the old rules.
"Besides, what is a little girl going to teach Wan Shi Tong,"
"He Who Knows 10,000 Things?"
"Well, since you've been down in the spirit world, the humans have invented radio."
" Yes, I am well aware of the radio."
 But do you know how it works?
 Of course I do.
"There is a box, and inside the box, there is a tiny man who sings and plays musical instruments."
" Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves."
Radio takes those sound waves and converts them into electromagnetic energy that is transmitted through the spectrum...
" All right, enough."
I did not know this.
"Apparently, I have been fed some misinformation about the existence of tiny men in boxes."
"Still, I'm not interested in that human garbage."
Now go away.
" My grandfather was the Avatar, and I came to the spirit world with the new Avatar to find the spirit portals."
I would think that you'd wanna help me.
" You came with the Avatar, hm?"
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
"Fine, you may look around, but don't break anything."
I'll know.
"Come on, Furry-Foot."
We gotta hurry.
" They say that the game of Pai Sho was invented by the spirits, although some of them don't seem to grasp it very well."
 Just hold on.
I'm thinking.
" As you can see, it is a game that requires great patience, but time does not mean much to us here."
 How long have you lived here?
" Oh, I've been here for many years."
"I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits, so when my work was done in the material world,"
I chose to leave my body behind and come to the spirit world.
"It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends."
"Korra, what's wrong?"
" I came here with my friend, but I lost her, and now I'm all alone."
" You're not alone, Korra."
It's okay.
No. It's not okay.
"Jinora's gone, and I need to find her."
"She's lost, and we need to go home."
I don't like the spirit world.
I don't want to be here anymore.
 Did you say something to her?
Me? You're the one with the big mouth.
" Korra, please, stop."
Look at what you're doing to everyone.
 I did that?
" In the spirit world, your emotions become your reality, especially for the Avatar because you are the bridge between the two worlds."
You must try to stay positive.
I'm sorry.
 There. You see?
 I can make the sun shine?
" Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it."
"But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see."
 I'm looking for my friend.
I want her here now.
Why didn't she come out like the sun?
I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy.
 But what am I supposed to do?
" Sometimes, the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else."
This little fellow needs to go home as well.
"Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours."
 I'll take him home.
Where do I go?
" The dragon-bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak."
It's not in here either.
I have to find the portals.
Korra's probably waiting for me there right now.
I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are.
Could you help me?
Thanks. This is it.
The Tree of Time.
That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu.
"""The elders believed that as long as the portals"
"""are closed during the harmonic convergence,"
"""Vaatu will remain imprisoned"
"""and the battle between good and evil"
"""will not be fought again."
"""But if both portals are opened,"
"""spirit energy is amplified greatly."
"""During the harmonic convergence,"
"""this energy will be great enough"
"""to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds,"
"""and the material world will again risk being consumed by darkness."""
We have to warn Korra.
 Leaving so soon?
"When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor,"
I had to see it with my own eyes.
I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself.
What kind of a father is he?
 Better than you.
"Wan Shi Tong, how can you be helping him?"
"Unalaq has proven to be a true friend to the spirits, unlike the Avatar."
Why would you wanna help
Vaatu escape?
He'll destroy everything.
 Don't believe everything you read.
Why don't you come with me so you can do some first-hand research?
Furry-Foot?
 This looks scary.
Will you come with me?
This is something that you must do on your own.
"The people who have been coming to the spirit world lately have brought darkness and anger, so that is what you see now."
But you have light and peace inside of you.
"If you let it out, you can change the world around you."
"Besides, look at this little fellow."
This mountain is his home.
"When you first met him, you were frightened."
But does he seem scary to you now?
 No.
 Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine a light on them.
It was good to meet you.
"Come visit me again, in this life or the next."
 Bye.
Okay. Time for you to go home.
Light and peace.
Light and peace.
 I'm not afraid of you.
You're not scary.
You just look that way.
I have light inside.
It's okay.
You can be my friends.
"My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon-bird home."
<i>T.</i>
Iroh said you could be nice.
Do you wanna help me?
"All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora."
<i>T.</i>
That's where Vaatu is.
" So you've returned, Raava."
"The harmonic convergence is coming soon, and this time,"
I'm going to wipe you out for good.
"I think you've said that before, Vaatu, but I'm here to close the portal."
You're not getting out.
" You might want to reconsider, that is, if you want to save your friend."
 Jinora.
I can't believe I trusted you.
You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits.
"But this, this isn't balance."
It's madness.
Now let her go.
" If you want your friend to make it out of the spirit world, you'll open the other portal now."
" Don't do it, Korra."
 What will it be?
"Open the portal, or lose your friend's soul forever?"
 Stop.
I'll do it.
<i>T.</i>
"Now, let Jinora go."
Ah!
You should have come through the portal.
Then you could do this.
Korra!
" I'll see you soon, Raava."
"Once the harmonic convergence comes,"
I'll be free from this prison.
And then I will have my revenge.
 Korra.
What was it like?
Did you manage to close the portal?
Was Jinora able to help you?
" Tenzin, I'm... I'm sorry."
 Where's Jinora?
W-Why isn't she waking up?
Korra.
What happened to my little girl?
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
 Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the northern portal and trapped Jinora in the spirit world.
"Back in Republic City, everybody loves"
Varrick's Nuktuk movers.
"Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer."
"And in the Southern Water Tribe,"
"Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the civil war, but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight."
 Dad's back!
 Where's Jinora?
No!
"Her spirit is trapped in the spirit world, but she's going to be all right."
 How could this happen?
 It was all my fault.
I should have never let Jinora enter the spirit world without me.
I couldn't protect her.
" I'm so sorry, Pema."
"I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
"Don't worry, honey,"
I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us.
 You've got a visitor.
" Hey, Mako."
 Hey.
What's with the fancy duds?
" I'm on my way to the big finale for ""Nuktuk: Hero of the South."""
"Yeah, everyone's gonna be there, except for, you know, you... because you're in jail and stuff."
 Thanks for the reminder.
" Hey, I brought you something."
I thought this would brighten up your new place.
Read the inscription.
"""Dear Mako,"
"Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling.""'"
Did you come by just to give me a poster?
" No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement."
"I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you."
"We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal."
 I am not a criminal!
" Of course I know that, but you do kinda look like one,"
"'cause you're in a jail, and that's where criminals live."
 I was set up!
Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war.
That's why he had me arrested.
" Ah, I see what you're doing."
You're going for the insanity defense.
Smart.
 No!
I'm trying to tell you that
Varrick isn't what he seems.
Where's Asami?
She'll listen to me.
" I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her."
You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad.
"Okay, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow."
And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy.
" Bolin, wait."
"If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere."
Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.
"Yeah, okay, big brother."
I promise.
Whew! That insanity defense is definitely gonna work.
 Should we wait another day?
Korra still might come with reinforcements.
 We can't wait any longer.
It's time we take back what is ours!
It's time to take back our city!
" Say ""Nuktuk."""
" There they are, folks, the sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most famous couple,"
Bolin and Ginger.
Let me get a picture.
" Wow, that was fun."
<i>And did you hear what Shire said'?</i>
We're Republic City's most famous couple.
" Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend."
We are not a couple.
 That's not what Shiro said.
Stop stuffing your moustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!
" You got it, Boss."
You two are the pinnacle of refinement.
"This star-studded event just keeps getting star-studdier, folks."
"President Raiko and the First Lady,"
"Buttercup Raiko, just arrived."
"And they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire,"
Varrick.
"There they are, my two most honored guests."
Mwah! What do you think?
No expense has been spared.
I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se and the best food from around the world.
"Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation."
They make the best red stuff over there.
"Fact! All right, picture time!"
"Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."
 I wanted to.
"Mr. President,"
"I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste."
And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!
"Varrick,"
"I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe."
" Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be."
"Thank you all for coming to the finale of ""Nuktuk: Hero of the South."""
"You know, when I first started this project, there were a lot of naysayers out there."
"""You can't make pictures move,"" they said."
"""You can't take some knucklehead Earthbender and make him a star,"" they said."
"""You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak,"" they said."
"Well, they're wrong."
"Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices."
And you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say.
They speak of the injustice that's happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.
My hope is that their words and this epic mover will inspire a real-life hero to rise up and help.
Thank you again. Enjoy the show.
" When last we left our hero, he was captured by the evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird."
"Amazingly, with the power of his whistling,"
Nuktuk escaped...
 And decided to seek out counsel.
" Thank you, wise sage."
I will travel to Republic City and seek help.
 Have a seat.
I'm just working on a cure for the common cold.
No longer will my citizens suffer from the sniffles.
"Mr. President, there's something more important than the sniffles right now."
I need your help to stop the evil Unalaq.
" Did you say ""help""?"
"If there is one thing I love doing, it's helping people"
"The seal-lion seemed a bit far-fetched, but the portrayal of this president is right on the money."
 I think this is your best mover yet.
 I just wish Mako was here to see it.
Mmm. I like to eat the top off the Varri-cake first.
 I just try to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once.
I love our job.
 Huh?
 Northern Water Tribe automatons!
Nooo!
"Bee bo bop,"
Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq.
Must destroy Nuktuk.
 Ha ha!
Aah!
Looks like you forgot that water and automatons don't mix.
Beep bop boo.
"Oh, no, circuits not working."
We did it!
But wait. Where's Juji?
 Nuk-no!
" You can't die, Juji."
Not on my watch.
"It's okay, Nuktuk."
At least I got to be...
Your friend.
"""Juji!"
 Are you okay?
It seems like this mover is really getting to you.
You do know Juji's not really dead?
Of course I know. Juji's fine.
He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth.
Oops. Spoiler. Sorry.
 Then what's wrong?
 I guess I just miss my friends.
"Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around."
"Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing... business lady stuff."
Team Avatar's fallen apart.
 I know.
Things have changed so much since we first met.
Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?
You go ahead.
I need another minute.
That's weird.
Whoa... ahh!
Ugh!
 They're after the president!
" You're too late, Nuktuk."
"Soon, my doomsday device will shoot this block of ice into the earth's core, freezing the entire planet."
And I will be the ruler of Ice Earth!
 I don't think so.
I don't think so!
 Huh! Ha!
"Mr. President, get back!"
I'm here to help.
Looks like there's nowhere to go.
[a d Uhh!
Secure the president and call for backup immediately!
" Nuktuk, look out!"
" Bolin, look out!"
 Hyah!
 This is unbelievable!
"Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth discs at once, which would normally be illegal."
"But then again, he's fighting three Waterbenders, so all rules are out the window."
 Tell me who sent you!
It was Varrick.
"Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!"
 I think this is our cue to exit.
 Where do you think you're going?
 It's a knockout!
 They're falling back.
 Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the North.
Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.
"I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming."
"Actually, someone did."
Remember Mako?
You've got a great officer on your hands.
 He's one of the best.
 Mwah!
I can't believe my boyfriend is a real-life hero.
"Boyfriend? Wait, stop."
I thought you said we weren't a couple.
You really are as dumb as those rocks.
Of course we're a couple.
" Bolin, you saved the president."
And you proved Mako was right all along.
We have to go tell him what happened.
Yeah.
" Oh, you meant right now."
 President Raiko...
" Avatar Korra, what's wrong?"
"Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed."
Unalaq doesn't just want to take over the South anymore.
He wants to destroy the whole world.
 Unalaq is gonna destroy the world?
He really does have a doomsday device?
"He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during harmonic convergence, which is only a few days away."
"If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over."
"Sir, we desperately need your help."
"I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
 There are lives on the line!
And my daughter is one of them.
"Raiko, you must reconsider."
" I'm aware that lives are on the line, and that's precisely why my troops are staying here."
"If the world is going to be thrown into chaos, like you claim,"
I need to protect my citizens.
I'm sorry.
 Sir...
Nuktuk needs your help.
I know you love helping people.
" Son, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
 I never should have saved that guy.
"If you guys need help,"
I'm here for you.
" Yeah, me too."
 Thank you.
It's so good to see you guys again.
"Wait, where's Mako?"
 So how was the big premiere?
I saved the president!
In real life!
" Wait, what?"
 You were right about Varrick.
He tried to kidnap Raiko!
 I knew it.
" But it didn't work, because of you."
And because of me.
Let's just say we both did good.
Beifong says you're free to go.
"Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
" Don't worry about it, bro."
" Nice job, Mako."
You're going to make a great detective.
"But, Chief, there aren't any detective openings right now."
" Actually, we have two openings."
 Mwah.
"Mako, I missed you so much."
" Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?"
Korra's back.
"Korra, hey, I missed you too."
So you're not still mad at me?
 Why would I be mad?
"We had that fight before you left, remember?"
" No, not really."
"I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while."
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.
Was it a bad fight?
 Uh... mm... no.
"No, it... it wasn't that bad."
" Korra, we don't have much time."
We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.
I think I know just the man to talk to.
"Guys, hey! What do you think?"
"Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special."
I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.
"Zhu Li, come on! We got guests."
Whip up a pot of that green tea I love.
" Yes, sir."
 Zhu Li's in prison with you?
Of course. I don't go anywhere without my assistant. Do you?
" We're not interested in your tea, and this isn't a friendly visit."
 Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened.
I did some good things too.
"Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?"
I did.
"Bolin, who got you into the movers?"
I did.
"Asami, who saved your company?"
I did.
"Mako, who got you thrown in jail?"
I did!
"Oh, yeah,"
I guess that was a bad thing.
" You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the president."
Those are pretty bad too.
 I wasn't going to hurt him.
I just needed to start a war.
"Well, a bigger war."
" Well, we're gonna end it."
Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
The Future Industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.
 You have a battleship?
 Of course I do!
"I bought the first one they made, named her the Zhu Li."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
"Yep. They're both cold, heartless war machines."
" Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
 All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're going to stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
 I hope my dad's all right.
 I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
 What about you?
 I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq. Looking for me?"
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
" Yes, I did."
Stop! He's mine.
 You are not the true chief.
I am. And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
 Bolin's a hero.
The mover star stopped
"Varrick's kidnapping attempt on President Raiko, proving his brother's innocence."
"Mako and Korra were reunited, but Korra has no memory of their breakup."
"Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is still trapped in the spirit world, and Tonraq and his Southern forces have been defeated."
Now it's up to team Avatar to stop Unalaq before harmonic convergence.
 What's up with the coat?
And where did you get that pie?
 It's a Varrick ship.
You never know what you're gonna find.
There's a whole level filled with funhouse mirrors.
"Of course, there's also the cat-gator deck."
I miss that guy.
He really knew how to make a long trip interesting.
So have you told Korra yet about how you guys broke up and then you kind of started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?
 You wanna keep it down?
I'm waiting for the right moment.
" Oh, Mako."
"You know, a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech."
You just have to do it fast and get it over with.
I hate it when you listen to me.
Fine.
 Unalaq will be waiting for you.
You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.
" I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another 10,000 years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born!"
"Thanks, Mako."
 Uh... um...
 Did you want something?
" Uh, no, no, nothing."
"As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main port."
"Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the spirit world."
"Whoa, since when does my little brother want to crash or blast through anything?"
I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.
" We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad overaggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship."
Really? And what do you suggest?
An attack like this calls for strategy.
I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the Hurricane Straits.
"We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses."
I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now.
This is serious.
 Are we almost there?
 Almost.
But I just picked up a distress signal from the Southern troops.
There's a problem.
. Mom!
 I'm so happy you're here.
 Where's Dad?
Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.
 I'll get him back.
 Where is my mother?
 She's in the healing hut.
So many injured.
 What happened?
Her soul is trapped in the spirit world.
"Oh, my goodness."
How long has she been away?
 Almost a week.
"I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away."
"You're the only one who can help her now, Mom."
How much longer can she survive like this?
 I don't know.
But she's very strong to have lasted this long.
 I talked to the rebels.
They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded.
Harmonic convergence is only a few hours away.
Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
 There's no use in talking anymore.
We know what our mission is.
 A suicide mission.
"You know, I was in a similar situation once."
"My platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week, but when we finally located the only oasis for 100 miles, it was surrounded by angry Sandbenders."
I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above.
"So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog-monkeys..."
 Enough of your ridiculous lies.
Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?
Hold on. Maybe Bumi's right.
"We don't have a catapult and hog-monkeys, but we have a flying bison, and there's a plane on Varrick's ship."
Maybe we can attack from above.
 What are you thinking?
"Mako, Bolin, and I can use the plane to create a distraction and scatter some of the defenses."
"You, Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening."
 Let's get moving.
" What are we still doing here, Father?"
"The invasion was completely successful, and the Southern Tribe is under our control."
The spirit portals are open.
You've restored balance.
Now we would like to go home.
 You don't understand.
Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish.
What else is there?
The Water Tribe is united.
"After today, there will be no more Water Tribe, no more nations of any kind."
"The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent and new, and I will lead this glorious revolution."
Now go outside and get the troops ready to defend the spirit portal.
From whom?
We've already beaten everyone.
 The Avatar will be here soon.
She has no choice.
 Are you ready?
"I'm an Earthbender strapped to the wing of a plane hundreds of feet in the air, so no."
Don't worry. There's no way they'll be expecting this.
 I think they were expecting it.
Asami!
 Get ready.
Fire!
 There are spirits everywhere.
I don't see an opening.
Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side.
Hold on!
The spirits are weighing Oogi down.
We're losing altitude.
"Get off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!"
Whoa!
"If I go, you're coming with me."
Aah!
 Bumi!
 I wish Varrick was filming this.
We could call it
"""Nuktuk: Sky Warrior."""
 Brace yourselves.
Dad.
" Korra, I'm so sorry."
I failed you.
 Don't give up.
Harmonic convergence isn't here yet.
We still have a chance.
 We tried.
" Congratulations, everyone."
You've all got front-row seats for the beginning of the new world order.
"You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq."
Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful.
"It will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened for the last 10,000 years."
You think what Avatar Wan did was good?
Driving almost all the spirits from this world?
"The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos."
"You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't be a bridge."
We should live together as one.
" Even if Vaatu escapes,"
"I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did."
"It's true that, when Wan fused with Raava, he tipped the scales in her favor."
"But this time,"
I'll be here to level the playing field.
"When harmonic convergence comes,"
I will fuse with Vaatu.
"And together, we will become the new Avatar."
A Dark Avatar.
Your era is over.
 Think about what you're doing.
"I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man."
You're still my brother.
You're Eska and Desna's father.
Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?
I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter.
"The only difference is that, while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power,"
I will be in complete alignment with mine.
Vaatu and I will be as one.
No one will be able to stand against us.
Keep them locked up.
"After the harmonic convergence,"
I will come for Korra.
" Yes, Father."
 I failed in every way.
We've lost Jinora forever.
There's still a chance.
They didn't get Bumi.
"Oh, you want to play some more."
"Well, bring it on."
"Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"
"Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here."
Reinforcements!
"All right, soldiers."
Looks like it's on us to save the day.
"Luckily, I've got a plan."
" Eska, Desna, listen to me."
You've got to help us stop Unalaq.
"I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
 We will never turn on our father.
" Please, if you let me out now,"
I can still stop him from destroying everything.
"Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe."
"Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
You don't know what you're talking about.
Our father is the wisest man in the world.
"If he says what he is doing is right,"
I believe him.
Huh?
"You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time,"
I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law.
" All right, spirit army, your general is here."
Follow me!
It's working.
It's not working.
Get me out of here!
<i>Whoa-hoe'.!</i>
 Aah!
"All right, guys. Rescue time."
"Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?"
"I did it all with my trusty flute and... oh, never mind."
You wouldn't believe it anyway.
Let's get moving.
 You run into the portal.
I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you.
"No, you're too hurt."
You need a healer.
"Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?"
 Mm-hmm.
 This is my fight now.
 Korra.
I love you.
" I love you too, Dad."
 Yip-yip.
" Once we're inside, you go find Jinora."
"Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape."
Wait a second.
Worst-case scenario.
"So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals, and let's just say something happens to you."
Are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity?
" If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after harmonic convergence."
If not...
Let's go.
"Tenzin, go find Jinora."
 Come on!
" You're running out of time, Raava."
I know you feel it coming.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
" After 10,000 years, harmonic convergence is here again, and the dark spirit Vaatu is free."
"Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal to rescue Jinora's spirit."
Asami split from the group and took the injured Tonraq to safety.
"So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar!"
"Raava, nothing could stop this moment."
Harmonic convergence is upon us again.
I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq.
You're going right back in that prison.
Aah!
Aah!
Don't let Unalaq back in the spirit world!
 We're on it!
 Jinora.
"Jinora's spirit, do you hear me?"
It's your Uncle Bumi.
" Ah, this isn't working."
"We can't just randomly wander the spirit world, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her!"
We just need to employ the simple rules of tracking.
First we locate her footprints... then we follow them.
Do you even know what spirit footprints look like?
Do spirits even leave footprints?
"Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the spirit world."
Let me try something.
Ommmmm
Jinora is over there.
I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction.
 We're in the spirit world.
There's spiritual energy in every direction!
 Enough!
We can't do this by ourselves.
We need a spirit guide.
There!
"Spirit, hello."
"I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance."
"You dare wake me, human?"
Humans in the spirit world belong in one place only!
 Aah!
 Aah!
 Whoa-oa-oa!
Oof!
" Well, that didn't work."
Now where are we?
 We're completely lost.
 Oh! Uhh!
No!
Huh?
I don't know if we can win this fight.
 We don't need to win.
We just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the spirit world.
Huh?
 We're walking in circles!
I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times!
 That's not the same mushroom.
" Yes, I am."
See? Even it knows we're lost.
"Oh, sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother."
What's that?
" Mushroom, is that you?"
Nope. Wasn't me.
 Iroh?
 How... where... it's been so long.
 Almost 40 years.
It's nice to see you again.
 How did you know we were here?
My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost.
I came to show you the way out.
" Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out... we're looking for my daughter."
"I'm sorry to hear that, but you shouldn't be here."
"Vaatu has escaped, and darkness threatens to take over."
 I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.
 I understand.
But I beg you to be careful.
"If you travel too deep into the spirit world, you could end up in a place where only the lost will ever find you."
A place where only the lost can find you... that's it!
I know where to find Jinora!
" I'm locking you away for another 10,000 years, Vaatu!"
 Unalaq?
Are you out there?
He must have gone home?
"Hello, my feeble turtle-duck."
 Aah!
 Huh?
 Don't let them escape this time.
Are you sure this is the best way to find Jinora?
 Trust me.
"Hey, you, spirit... wake up!"
 You again?
I thought we were going to be taken to a prison.
 This is a prison.
Welcome to the Fog of Lost Souls.
You will never escape.
 Aah!
<i>'</i> Stop!
<i>. No!</i>
 We are now one.
"Now a new era for spirits and humans will begin, and I will lead them all as the new Avatar."
"Well, I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet."
What kind of prison doesn't have any bars or walls?
We could walk right out of here.
The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans.
I read about it in an ancient text.
The fog is actually a spirit...
"That infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories."
How long can you be trapped in here?
 I am Zhao the Conqueror!
I am the Moonslayer!
I will capture the Avatar!
I am Zhao the Conqueror!
I am the Moonslayer!
I will capture the Avatar!
Hopefully we're not trapped in here as long as that guy.
You! You're him!
The last Airbender!
Ah! No!
Get off me!
You've grown... but I will still defeat you!
Ah! Ohh!
"Come back, Avatar! Face me!"
I am Zhao the Conqueror!
I will capture you!
Victory will be mine!
" If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog."
Aah!
Give in. Your time is over.
" Korra, this fight is not over."
Raava...
 Vaatu cannot win.
"Do not give in to 10,000 years of darkness."
You are the Avatar.
 Aah!
 You cannot win!
 Jinora! Jinora!
 Wait a second.
 What?
Do you hear something?
Yes. They're all around us.
"The cannibals, they're everywhere."
"Bumi, you must focus your mind right now."
There are no cannibals.
" Yes, there are!"
They're gonna eat every last one of us!
Who are you two?!
" Kya, we're your brothers."
You must remember before the fog infects you.
"No, you are just a vision."
I have no family.
You can't tie me down!
 They're closing in!
I gotta get outta here! Aah!
' Aah! ' No!
Bumi! Kya!
Come back!
" Please, let us out."
 His groveling is pathetic.
But I do enjoy the sweet scent of desperation.
 Come on!
Your dad has become an evil monster.
He's trying to bring on eternal darkness!
Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?
 Father was going to let me expire when we tried to open the northern portal.
Perhaps we should rethink our position.
 Yes!
 No.
Don't listen to him.
His words are poisoning your mind.
 What's with this outburst of emotion?
" I'm sorry, I can't help it."
It's just so sad... that I'll never get to be with you again.
 What?
Explain yourself further.
"Eska, I've always loved you, and I've always wanted to be with you... but now that the world is ending,"
I'm never gonna get that chance.
" We could have been together, but you left me at the altar."
 I was scared!
I was scared of my true feelings for you.
I should have never left you!
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry that we'll never have a chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a... big fire of love flames.
 You'll never defeat my father.
"But should you survive, perhaps we can spend eternal darkness together."
"Wow, that was the best acting I've ever seen."
You completely fooled her!
" Yeah, right, that... that was acting."
 They will certainly perish.
 I must stay focused.
"Remember who you are, Tenzin."
You are the son of Avatar Aang.
You are the hope for future generations of Airbenders.
The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.
But what if I fail?
Then your father's hope for the future dies with you.
I can't fail!
You will.
Aah! Stop it!
I am the son of Avatar Aang.
I am the hope for future generations of Airbenders.
I am the son of Avatar Aang!
" Hello, my son."
" Dad, I've failed you."
"I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down."
I'll never be the man you were.
 You are right.
You are trying to hold on to a false perception of yourself.
"You are not me, and you should not be me."
You are Tenzin.
 I am not a reflection of my father.
I am Tenzin. I am Tenzin.
Jinora!
 Ah... what happened?
 I think our brother saved us.
 Dad.
" You're going to be okay, sweetie."
I'm here.
 What happened?
The last thing I remember is dark spirits taking me away.
"You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls, but I wasn't going to let you stay there."
" I'm so happy to see you, Dad."
 Korra!
 He's got the light spirit!
Aah! -aah!
Aah!
 The world's in trouble.
What are you talking about?
How do you know?
 I can feel it.
 What happened?
 It's Korra.
This light spirit will guide you out of the spirit world.
I have to go help.
" Jinora, wait!"
 Now...
"10,000 years of darkness begins!"
Aah! -aah!
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
"After fusing with Vaatu,"
Unalaq became a Dark Avatar and ripped Korra and Raava apart.
"By destroying Raava,"
Unalaq and Vaatu transformed into the most powerful dark spirit that's ever lived.
"Tenzin managed to free Jinora from the Fog of Lost Souls, but her spiritual quest isn't over yet."
Can anyone save the world from eternal darkness?
 Ooh.
Pretty.
"General Iroh, are your ships in position?"
" Yes, Mr. President, but I need to know what kind of enemy we're dealing with."
It's time to take back the physical world.
 Fire!
 Monster attack!
 They're over here!
"Please, wake up."
" They're going to be all right, but I need to get them into some spirit water right away."
 Thank goodness you're all okay.
 Did you find Jinora?
" I was able to rescue her soul, but she wasn't ready to return to her body yet."
She sensed the world was in grave danger.
 She was right.
Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?
"No, they fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her."
Vaatu won.
No! I'm too young to live through
"10,000 years of darkness."
"Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?"
" When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too."
" If that's true, then..."
 The cycle is over.
I'm the last Avatar.
"I'm so sorry, Tenzin."
" She needs you now, more than ever."
 It's going to destroy the entire city.
We're going down.
 It's pandemonium in the streets.
Giant vines are destroying everything.
This is Shiro Shinobi signing off...
"Zhu Li, commence operation"
"""Winged Freedom""!"
Do the thing!
"The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but perhaps I can."
 No one can help me now.
"I know I haven't been the best mentor to you, but I realized it was because"
I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself.
There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.
 How?
 Let go of your attachment to who you think you are and connect with your inner spirit.
 Haven't you heard anything I said?
Raava is gone.
I'm not connected to a spirit anymore.
 I'm not talking about Raava.
Raava is not who you are.
Come with me.
I need to show you something.
Why are you showing me
Vaatu's prison?
 Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu.
"This is the Tree of Time, and the legends say that its roots bind the spirit and physical worlds together."
And you think this tree can help me somehow?
" Yes, I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe."
 These are my memories.
 The Tree of Time remembers all.
"Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit."
"You have always been strong, unyielding, and fearless."
 Avatar Wan.
"Before he fused with Raava,"
Wan was just a regular person.
 But he was brave and smart and always wanted to defend the helpless.
 That's right.
"He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was."
He wasn't defined by Raava any more than you are.
Everyone in Republic City is in danger.
" You have to help them, Korra."
 How?
They're halfway around the world.
 Do as the ancients once did.
Connect to the cosmic energy of the universe.
"Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself."
 You really think I can do this?
 I have no doubt.
Thank you for not giving up on me.
 I'm proud of you.
"If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?"
 He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness.
One cannot exist without the other.
 Find the light in the dark.
" Uh... what did you say to her, exactly?"
 Korra's back.
 And she's a blue giant.
You are looking for something that is gone.
Raava has been destroyed.
And soon you will be too!
 They're coming for Korra.
 Leave my Bolin alone!
 I am so done with spirits.
 Eska!
I love you!
Mwah!
Let's face the end of the world together!
 You're so romantic.
" With you out of the way,"
I will be the one true Avatar.
" Mommy, it's Jinora."
She's... beautiful.
What? Let me see.
"Be careful, sweetie!"
No!
 Raava.
 Go in peace.
Harmonic convergence is nearly over.
We must return to the spirit world so we can fuse once again.
" I'll see you soon, Dad."
"Gran-Gran, I missed you."
 What about Korra and the others?
 Don't worry.
They're all right.
Korra saved the world.
 Her Avatar spirit has returned.
 It's over.
 Mwah.
I don't even know what to say.
 You were amazing.
"And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow!"
I just wish Varrick had been here to film it.
It would have been the greatest mover ever.
"After ""The Nuktuk Chronicles,"" of course."
" I'm sorry about your father, but he was already fused with Vaatu."
I couldn't save him.
It seems cousin Korra is under the impression we are saddened by our father's demise.
 But I will not miss him at all.
"In the end, he became a deplorable man."
 Agreed.
But how will we explain this to mother?
"So I was thinking,"
I'm not really a fan of the long-distance relationship thing.
So how about you move to Republic City with me?
 I do not think that will be possible.
" Okay, Desna can come too."
" I will not be joining you, Bolin."
Desna and I must return home.
 But you said...
 Eternal darkness was upon us.
I became caught up in the moment.
 Yeah.
I guess I did too.
But... you will always hold a special place in the organ that pumps my blood.
"I will remember you fondly, my turtle-duck."
"Bum-Ju, you're okay."
"I missed you, little buddy."
"Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected to your past lives?"
 No.
I think that link is gone forever.
 I see.
Why don't you close the portals and we'll go home.
 Maybe I shouldn't.
 What do you mean?
 What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?
What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals?
What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart?
"Well, what do you think I should do?"
I think you should trust your instincts.
There is nothing else I can teach you.
You are the Avatar.
"Whatever your decision,"
I support you.
" Hey, can we talk?"
 Of course.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had.
"I know I said it wasn't that bad, but that's not exactly true."
"I, um... I broke up with you."
 I remember.
But I thought you said you lost part of your memory?
"I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back."
I'm sorry for blowing up at you.
 That's okay.
I think we both said some things that we regret.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
" I know I should have, but I didn't wanna hurt you all over again."
I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup too.
 I think we both know that this... us... doesn't work.
 You're right.
 It's over.
For real this time.
" I'll always love you, Korra."
 And I'll always love you.
 You want a hug?
Hmmm.
 The War of the Water Tribes is over.
Unalaq has been defeated and the Northern fleet is returning home.
"The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent."
"And the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief."
"I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path."
So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open.
Humans can now physically enter the spirit world and spirits will be free to roam our world.
I will no longer be the bridge.
Humans and spirits must learn to live together.
My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance.
Harmonic convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy.
I can feel it.
Things will never be the same again.
We are entering a new age.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
THE WORLD HAS ENTERED A NEW AGE.
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
CREATED AN ENERGY SHIFT
THE LIKES OF WHICH
HAS NEVER BEEN FELT BEFORE.
"AND AFTER TWO WEEKS,"
REPUBLIC CITY CONTINUES
TO RECOVER
FROM KORRA'S EPIC BATTLE
WITH UNAVAATU.
"VINES HAVE SPROUTED UP ALL OVER,"
CREATING POCKETS OF WILDS
THE SPIRITS
HAVE COME TO CALL HOME.
WHAT OTHER CHANGES
ARE IN STORE FOR OUR CITY?
"COME BACK, BUM-JU."
IF YOU DON'T WANNA WEAR
"THE SWEATER I MADE YOU, THAT'S FINE."
I'M SORRY I GOT MAD.
"BUM-JU, I'M RUNNING OUT OF TREE."
CAN WE GO DOWN NOW?
"BUM-JU, A LITTLE HELP?"
AH! AHH!
LOOK!
I'M AIRBENDING.
AH!
"WOW, THAT STILL HURT A LOT."
HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA
CLEAR AWAY ALL THESE VINES?
I DON'T GET IT!
"I CAN VANQUISH VAATU,"
BUT NOT A BUNCH OF STUPID VINES?
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A WAY.
WHY DO YOU WANNA
GET RID OF THEM?
YOU CHANGED THE WORLD.
WE'RE CONNECTED
WITH THE SPIRITS AGAIN.
THE WILDS ARE THEIR HOME.
I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE
ARE AS EXCITED ABOUT IT
AS YOU ARE.
I GOTTA GO FACE THE PRESS
AND TELL THEM
I STILL DON'T HAVE A WAY
TO GET RID OF THE VINES.
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.
"MR. PRESIDENT,"
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT
YOUR APPROVAL RATINGS
ARE NOW NEARLY AS LOW
AS THE AVATAR'S?
HAVE YOU SEEN TODAY'S HEADLINE?
"IT SAYS, ""RAIK.OH-NO."
"POLLS PAN PREZ PLANS!"""
I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH
SNAPPY PUT-DOWNS IN THE PRESS.
I'M FACING THIS CALAMITY
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER CITIZEN.
THERE'S A TREE GROWING
RIGHT THROUGH MY OFFICE.
YOU THINK I'M NOT DOING
EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET RID OF IT?
" A FEW QUESTIONS, PLEASE!"
 AVATAR KORRA!
DO YOU REGRET THE WAY
YOU HANDLED THE UNALAQ CRISIS?
WHY ARE YOU FORCING THE INTEGRATION
OF SPIRITS IN REPUBLIC CITY?
"LISTEN, I'VE BEEN TRYING"
EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF
"TO GET RID OF THESE VINES,"
BUT...
 WHY CAN'T YOU FIX THIS?
 ARE THE VINES HERE TO STAY?
IS THIS PART OF
YOUR NEW WORLD ORDER?
LOOK!
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
WAS JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO GET EVERYTHING
BACK TO NORMAL.
THE AVATAR HAS PUT US ALL
"IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION,"
 BUT MY ADMINISTRATION...
 OH!
I'M SORRY.
DID I PUT YOU
IN A DIFFICULT POSITION
BY FIGHTING THE GIANT FORCE
OF PURE EVIL
THAT WAS GOING TO DESTROY
THE WHOLE WORLD?
MAYBE YOUR ADMINISTRATION
COULD'VE HANDLED THAT!
THAT'S ALL! NO MORE QUESTIONS!
THIS IS A DISASTER.
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE MY POLL NUMBERS.
8% APPROVAL?
WHO WERE THEY ASKING?
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT TO HEART.
PEOPLE ARE JUST FRUSTRATED.
I DON'T BLAME THEM.
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THIS.
I'M THE AVATAR.
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?
DAD!
WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?
"THE MOST AMAZING, WONDROUS,"
FANTASTICAL THING JUST OCCURRED.
"OKAY, BUM-JU AND I"
HAD A LITTLE FIGHT.
"I MADE HIM THIS SWEATER,"
AND HE DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE IT.
AND I'LL ADMIT
"IT MIGHT NEED WORK,"
BUT IT WAS
MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT KNITTING.
SO I WAS A LITTLE HURT.
HILARIOUS.
"TIME FOR DINNER, EVERYONE."
NO! CHECK THIS OUT.
I CAN AIRBEND!
"YEAH, WAIT."
SERIOUSLY. I WAS DOING IT.
"OH, HOLD ON. I JUST..."
MAYBE IF I...
NO.
I SWEAR I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.
STOP WAVING
YOUR ARMS AROUND AT THE TABLE.
IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.
IT'S NOT A JOKE.
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?
BUMI SAYS HE AIRBENDED
"EARLIER, BUT HE CAN'T NOW."
"OH, AND I GUESS HE'S NOT"
VERY GOOD AT KNITTING EITHER.
"I GOTTA SAY,"
I LOVE BEING A PART OF THIS FAMILY.
"YOU GOT THE GRUMPY DAD,"
THE WACKY UNCLE.
"THE PUT-UPON MOM, CRAZY KIDS."
 THIS IS GREAT.
 WHERE'S MAKO?
"OH, YOU MEAN"
THE BROODING TEENAGER?
HE'S STAYING
AT THE POLICE STATION.
STILL?
I TOLD HIM
TENZIN INVITED US TO STAY HERE
SINCE OUR APARTMENT
"IS A VINE HABITAT NOW,"
BUT HE SAID
HE HAD TO FOCUS ON WORK.
OH! DID YOU SEE THAT?
I THINK THE NAPKIN MOVED.
YOU BLEW ON IT.
WAIT!
MAYBE I CAN ONLY DO IT
WHEN MY LIFE IS IN DANGER.
"BOLIN, BEND"
A GIANT BOULDER AT ME.
"YEAH, I DON'T THINK"
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE BENDING
"GIANT BOULDERS, YOU CAN DO IT OUTSIDE."
NO ONE IS BENDING
GIANT BOULDERS!
"LOOK ALIVE, UNCLE BUMI!"
AH!
I TOLD YOU!
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU'RE ACTUALLY AN AIRBENDER.
WAIT UNTIL I TELL MOM.
SHE'S GONNA LOVE THIS.
OW!
POLICE.
HE WHAT? SLOW DOWN.
"OKAY, I'M ON MY WAY."
WHAT THE HECK DID ALL THIS?
IT WAS MY BROTHER.
HE'S OUT OF CONTROL!
"OKAY, JUST TELL ME"
WHAT HAPPENED.
"WE WERE ARGUING ABOUT THE BOOKS,"
"AND DAW WAS YELLING AT ME,"
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
THINGS STARTED FLYING AROUND!
HE WAS CREATING
THIS STORM LIKE...
LIKE WHAT?
"WELL, LIKE HE WAS AIRBENDING."
SIR... THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE AIRBENDERS
"IN THE ENTIRE WORLD,"
AND YOUR BROTHER
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.
"HE WAS FREAKING OUT, YELLING,"
"""WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?"""
"THEN, HE RAN INTO THE BACK ROOM"
AND LOCKED HIMSELF IN.
POLICE. OPEN UP.
GO AWAY!
"GET OUT HERE, SIR,"
OR I'M KNOCKING THIS DOOR DOWN.
ONE... TWO...
AH! I'M SO SORRY!
I TOLD YOU! AIRBENDING!
UGH!
I CAN'T FIGURE THIS THING OUT!
DO YOU THINK BEING
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
COULD'VE GIVEN HIM BENDING?
I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE.
MAYBE UNCLE BUMI
IS JUST A LATE BLOOMER.
I HAVE BEEN NOTICING
A CHANGE IN YOUR AURA LATELY.
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?
INVISIBLE SPIRIT MONSTER ATTACK?
LIN! YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS.
BUMI JUST STARTED AIRBENDING.
I'M AFRAID
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.
WHAT?
I GOT A CALL LAST NIGHT
ABOUT A GUY WHO JUST STARTED
AIRBENDING OUT OF NOWHERE.
YOU MEAN THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?
WHERE IS HE NOW?
HE... BLEW A DOOR DOWN ON ME
AND GOT AWAY.
WE'VE GOT AN ALL-POINTS BULLETIN
OUT ON HIM RIGHT NOW.
"WAIT, WE'LL HELP YOU"
LOOK FOR HIM.
WHERE SHOULD WE START?
"OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,"
YOU SHOULD...
YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT
TO THE POLICE.
"IT'S... POLICE BUSINESS,"
YOU KNOW.
"IT'S, UM... OFFICIAL."
OKAY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU KNOW YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY HERE
INSTEAD OF SLEEPING
AT THE POLICE STATION.
"NO, I'M FINE."
I SHOULD JUST GET... GOING.
SO!
AS YOU WERE...
LADIES.
THIS IS SO EXCITING!
NEW AIRBENDERS IN THE CITY?
I BET WE CAN FIND THAT GUY
BEFORE MAKO DOES.
YOU KNOW
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS.
"YOU'RE THE AVATAR,"
MASTER OF ALL THE ELEMENTS.
YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DRIVE.
"BESIDES, IT'S RELAXING."
CLUTCH! CLUTCH!
UGH! AH! UGH!
THAT'S THE BRAKE.
LET'S TRY AGAIN. YOU READY?
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
TALKING TO MAKO
IS GOING TO BE
LIKE PULLING TEETH?
"WELL, MAKO HAS NEVER BEEN"
"THE MOST ""IN TOUCH"
"WITH HIS FEELINGS"" GUY."
BUT IT'LL GET BETTER EVENTUALLY.
"SO WHEN I WAS GONE,"
DID HE TELL YOU
THAT WE BROKE UP?
YEAH. WE ALL KNEW.
 SORRY.
 THAT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING.
"ACTUALLY, I NEED TO TELL YOU"
"SOMETHING ABOUT THAT,"
AND I SHOULD'VE
"TOLD YOU THIS SOONER,"
"BUT... WHILE YOU WERE GONE,"
I... KIND OF... KISSED HIM.
I'M SORRY.
NO WONDER
HE'S SO NERVOUS AROUND US.
 YOU'RE NOT MAD?
 NO!
"I MEAN, I KISSED MAKO WHEN"
"HE WAS GOING OUT WITH YOU, SO."
YOU WHAT?
I'M SO SORRY!
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW!
I'M JUST KIDDING.
I KNEW A LONG TIME AGO.
"WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENED"
WITH MAKO
I'M GLAD
IT HASN'T COME BETWEEN US.
I'VE NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND
TO HANG OUT WITH
"AND TALK TO BEFORE,"
EXCEPT FOR NAGA.
THIS IS NICE.
VINE! VINE!
HEY! WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
"DON'T ASK ME, AVATAR."
YOU MADE THE WORLD THIS WAY.
WE'RE JUST LIVING IN IT.
"LOOK, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING"
"AGAINST SPIRITS,"
BUT THESE VINES
ARE CAUSING MAJOR PROBLEMS
ALL OVER THE CITY.
SPIRITS? VINES?
WE'RE ALL THE SAME.
SEEMS LIKE THE AVATAR
WOULD KNOW THAT.
"KORRA, YOU OKAY?"
I THINK THAT SPIRIT
JUST GAVE ME AN IDEA
HOW TO GET RID OF THESE VINES.
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
A LOT OF WATER.
"IT'S LIKE A DREAM, DAD."
"AFTER 170 YEARS, NEW AIRBENDERS."
DAD?
"WHEN A NEW GUY GETS AIRBENDING,"
DOES THAT MAKE HIM OUR BROTHER?
"WELL, IN A WAY,"
ALL AIRBENDERS ARE OUR FAMILY.
DOES THAT MEAN
I HAVE TO SHARE MY ROOM?
BECAUSE I LIKE
MY PERSONAL SPACE.
OF COURSE NOT.
BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO GET USED
TO NOT BEING
THE ONLY AIRBENDERS AROUND ANYMORE.
I HOPE WE HAVE ENOUGH
FOR AN ARMY.
I WANNA BE A COMMANDER
LIKE UNCLE BUMI.
AIR NOMADS
"DON'T HAVE ARMIES, MEELO."
BUT MAYBE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH
TO FILL THE TEMPLES AGAIN.
"WHAT'S WRONG, DADDY?"
I JUST WISH YOUR
GRANDFATHER WERE HERE TO SEE THIS.
WILL YOU BE AIRBENDER PRESIDENT?
NO.
BUT I THINK THE NEW AIRBENDERS
WILL NEED LOTS OF HELP
AND GUIDANCE
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A PART OF OUR NATION.
THAT'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY
"DON'T WORRY, DAD."
WE'LL HELP YOU.
I KNOW YOU WILL.
I HOPE THIS WORKS.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
I WAS ALERTED
THAT YOU HAD A NEW PLAN
"TO WIPE OUT THESE NOXIOUS WEEDS,"
SO I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT
EVERYONE TO BE HERE TO WATCH.
AVATAR KORRA!
 DO YOU REALLY THINK.
 NO QUESTIONS!
JUST STAND THERE. SILENTLY!
GO IN PEACE.
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO?
WILL YOU SEND THE SPIRITS
AWAY NOW?
HOW SOON CAN WE EXPECT PUBLIC
WATER SERVICE TO RESUME?
LOOK OUT!
"LET'S GO, PEOPLE. HURRY!"
HANG ON!
I THINK THAT
COULD'VE GONE BETTER.
CAN'T TALK. MEDITATING.
YOU MUST BE
AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE.
YOU HATE MEDITATING.
I THOUGHT THAT IF I REALLY TRIED
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTACT
"MY PAST AVATARS,"
SOMEONE WHO
KNOWS SOMETHING TO HELP ME.
BUT I CAN'T.
"THEY'RE GONE, AND I'M ALL ALONE."
DID I RUIN EVERYTHING
BY LEAVING THE SPRIT PORTALS OPEN?
YOU DIDN'T RUIN ANYTHING.
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT
"WAS BEST FOR THE WORLD,"
AND NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
CHANGE CAN BE GOOD OR BAD.
DEPENDING ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW.
I KNOW THE PEOPLE'S
POINT OF VIEW.
IT'S BAD.
"YOU'RE NOT THE PRESIDENT, KORRA."
YOUR JOB ISN'T TO FIX
THE DAILY PROBLEMS
OF EVERY PERSON
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO BRING BALANCE
TO THE ENTIRE WORLD.
AND THAT MEANS
"NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,"
SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.
 GREAT.
"ON THE OTHER HAND,"
SOME PEOPLE WILL BE VERY HAPPY.
LIKE ME.
WHAT YOU DID
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
MAY HAVE BROUGHT BACK
THE AIR NATION.
AND THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD
FOR RESTORING BALANCE.
THAT IS THE ACT
OF A GREAT AVATAR.
IT'S SCARY.
I HAVE ALL THIS POWER
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE
"DEPENDING ON ME,"
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
DOING HALF THE TIME.
IT SEEMS LIKE
I SHOULD BE... WISER.
TRUE WISDOM BEGINS WHEN
WE ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE.
"YOU STARTED A NEW AGE, KORRA."
THERE'S NO GOING BACK
TO THE PAST.
MAKO CALLED!
THE COPS FOUND
THE NEW AIRBENDER GUY.
BUT WHEN THEY TRIED
"TO BRING HIM IN,"
HE RAN AWAY AND CLIMBED
TO THE TOP OF KYOSHI BRIDGE
AND HE WON'T COME DOWN.
OOH! SORRY.
DID I INTERRUPT
AN AVATAR WISDOM SESSION?
AVATAR WISDOM'S
"A THING OF THE PAST, BOLIN."
 COME ON!
" OH, OKAY."
 IS THAT A GOOD THING?
 DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK.
"COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY,"
OR WE WILL BE FORCED
TO TAKE ACTION.
STAY BACK! I'M DANGEROUS!
SORRY!
"DON'T PANIC,"
I'M JUST HERE TO TALK.
PLEASE!
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,"
AND I DON'T WANNA HURT ANYONE.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
"ROUGH DAY, HUH?"
I'M HAVING
KIND OF A ROUGH DAY MYSELF.
YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN HERE?
"LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED."
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
"A BIG CHANGE,"
AND IT'S KIND OF MY FAULT.
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
THERE ARE OTHER AIRBENDERS
AND THEY WANNA HELP YOU.
ACTUALLY THEY'RE REALLY
EXCITED TO MEET YOU.
I DON'T WANNA BE AN AIRBENDER.
PLEASE! YOU'RE THE AVATAR.
MAKE IT STOP!
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.
BUT I PROMISE YOU
THINGS WILL GET BETTER
IF YOU JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE.
LET ME TAKE YOU
OVER TO AIR TEMPLE ISLAND
AND WE CAN
"TALK THIS THROUGH, OKAY?"
"DAW, THIS IS TENZIN."
HE'S GOING TO HELP YOU.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY MY PLEASURE
"TO MEET YOU, DAW."
I'VE NEVER MET
A NEW AIRBENDER BEFORE.
"WELL, AT LEAST NOT ONE"
WHOSE DIAPER
I DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE.
ACTUALLY I JUST FELL
"OFF A BRIDGE,"
SO I COULD USE A FRESH DIAPER
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
SO IS THIS THE DEAL?
"WE HAVE A CRISIS EVERY OTHER DAY NOW,"
THANKS TO YOU?
"LISTEN, I KNOW"
YOU'RE HAVING A TOUGH TIME
"GETTING USED TO THESE CHANGES,"
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.
BUT YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE
ARE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
TO LIVE WITH IT.
THE VINES AND THE SPIRITS
ARE HERE TO STAY.
"WELL, YOU KNOW"
WHO'S NOT HERE TO STAY? YOU!
I ORDER YOU TO LEAVE THIS CITY.
YOU'VE CAUSED NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE SINCE YOU ARRIVED.
DON'T WORRY.
I WAS ALREADY LEAVING.
I CAN SEE MY PATH NOW.
THERE ARE NEW AIRBENDERS
"OUT THERE,"
AND I'M GONNA FIND THEM
AND REBUILD THE AIR NATION.
DON'T THINK
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.
IT'S SO EXCITING.
WHO KNOWS
"WHO'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW,"
DISCOVERING THE GIFT OF
AIRBENDING FOR THE FIRST TIME?
" YOU KNOW THE DRILL, ZAHEER."
 OF COURSE.
HOPE YOU STILL LIKE RICE.
HAVE YOU EVER READ THE POETRY
OF THE GREAT AIRBENDING
GURU LAGHIMA?
WHAT?
GURU LAGHIMA
"LIVED 4,000 YEARS AGO"
IN THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
IT IS SAID THAT HE UNLOCKED THE
SECRET OF WEIGHTLESSNESS
AND BECAME UNTETHERED
"FROM THE EARTH,"
LIVING HIS FINAL 40 YEARS
WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING
THE GROUND.
"IS THAT HOW YOU PLAN TO ESCAPE,"
WITH SOMETHING YOU PICKED UP
FROM AN OLD AIRBENDER
CHILDREN'S STORY?
"LIKE ALL GREAT CHILDREN'S TALES,"
IT CONTAINS TRUTH
WITHIN THE MYTH.
"LAGHIMA ONCE WROTE,"
"""INSTINCT IS A LIE"
"TOLD BY A FEARFUL BODY,"
"""HOPING TO BE WRONG."""
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
IT MEANS THAT WHEN YOU BASE
YOUR EXPECTATIONS
"ONLY ON WHAT YOU SEE,"
YOU BLIND YOURSELF
TO THE POSSIBILITIES
OF A NEW REALITY.
UGH!
"AH, AH, AH."
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA
"SINGE YOUR FRIEND, WOULD YOU?"
HOW?
YOU'RE NOT A BENDER!
NATURE IS
"CONSTANTLY CHANGING, LIKE THE WIND."
NOW YOU MIGHT WANNA RATION
THAT BOWL OF RICE.
YOU'VE GOT THREE WEEKS
UNTIL THE NEXT SHIFT CHANGE.
"IT'S THE DAWNING OF A NEW AGE,"
"THE END OF THE WHITE LOTUS,"
"AND SOON, THE END OF THE AVATAR."
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
" AFTER 170 YEARS,"
THERE ARE NEW AIRBENDERS
"IN THE WORLD,"
AND BUMI IS ONE OF THEM.
"SO TOO IS THE MYSTERIOUS ZAHEER,"
WHO ESCAPED FROM
HIS REMOTE PRISON
THANKS TO HIS NEW ABILITY.
"NOW EXILED FROM REPUBLIC CITY,"
KORRA HAS MADE IT HER MISSION
TO FIND ALL THE NEW AIRBENDERS.
BUT WILL SHE AND TENZIN
BE ABLE TO BRING BACK THE AIR NATION?
 DID SOMEONE ORDER
A FULLY-EQUIPPED
FUTURE INDUSTRIES AIRSHIP?
" IT'S PERFECT. THANKS, ASAMI."
 I FIGURED IF WE'RE GOING
TO BA SING SE
"TO SEARCH FOR AIRBENDERS,"
WE SHOULD DO IT IN STYLE.
 YAY! AIRSHIP!
 I WANNA SEE.
" COME ON, POKI."
" WHILE YOU GUYS ARE GONE,"
PEMA AND I WILL HOLD DOWN
THE FORT.
WHO'S EXCITED TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH YOUR AUNTIE KYA?
OH.
 AWW. HE LIKES YOU.
" MAKO, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE."
" OF COURSE, KORRA. AVATAR..."
AVATAR KORRA.
"ONCE I RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE,"
I PROCEEDED TO CONTACT
VARIOUS LOCATIONS
WITHIN THE EARTH KINGDOM
"AS ORDERED BY YOU,"
THE AVATAR.
 RIGHT.
THE AVATAR THANKS YOU
FOR YOUR LOYAL SERVICE.
DID YOU FIND ANY MORE LEADS?
 THERE ARE REPORTS
OF AIRBENDERS
POPPING UP ALL OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.
I MARKED THE VILLAGES
ON THIS MAP.
YOU GUYS CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU.
" ACTUALLY, I WAS KIND"
"OF HOPING YOU COULD COME, TOO."
 REALLY?
"UM, IT'S PROBABLY BETTER"
IF I SIT THIS ONE OUT.
 I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN WEIRD
"BETWEEN US SINCE WE BROKE UP,"
BUT YOU'RE A PART OF TEAM AVATAR
AND WE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.
" I'M SORRY, I CAN'T."
" I'LL MISS YOU, SWEETIE."
" I'LL MISS YOU, TOO."
"ONCE WE FIND THE AIRBENDERS,"
I'LL SEND WORD.
YOU CAN JOIN US
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE THEN.
 HEY! HOW COME JINORA GETS
TO GO WITH YOU BUT WE DON'T?
THAT'S SO NOT FAIR.
" YEAH, WHAT THIS GIRL SAID."
NOT FAIR.
 BECAUSE IF AIRBENDERS
"SHOW UP HERE,"
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED
SOME GUIDANCE FROM YOU TWO.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB.
 REALLY?
"ME, A TEACHER?"
YAY!
 THOSE MAGGOTS WILL BOW TO ME.
" GO EASY ON THEM, SON."
" MAKO, WAIT A SEC."
" KORRA ALREADY ASKED, BRO."
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE
REPUBLIC CITY.
I HAVE A LIFE HERE AND A JOB.
 A LIFE? YOU SLEEP
UNDER YOUR DESK.
AND WHAT'S A MORE IMPORTANT JOB
THAN HELPING THE AVATAR
REBUILD AN ENTIRE CIVILIZATION?
 IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
DRIFTING APART FROM EVERYONE.
" WELL, DRIFT BACK. WE NEED YOU!"
"COME ON, MAKO, WE'RE GOING TO BA SING"
SE WHERE DAD GREW UP.
WHAT IF I MEET OUR GRANDMA
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME?
"AND SHE ASKS ME,"
"""WHERE'S YOUR SWEET BROTHER?"""
"AND I HAVE TO SAY,"
"""I'M SORRY, GRANDMA."
"""HE HAD SOME REALLY IMPORTANT"
"POLICE PAPERWORK TO FILE."""
AND SHE STARTS TO CRY
THOSE GRANDMA TEARS
"AND IS LIKE, ""MAKO! WHY?"
"""WHY, MAKO? I CAN'T GO ON."
"""I CAN'T..."" AND THEN SHE DIES."
" OKAY, ALL RIGHT."
I'LL COME WITH YOU.
I GUESS I GOTTA CALL BEIFONG.
SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY.
 BYE. WE'LL MISS YOU.
" AS OF NOW,"
THESE ARE THE TOWNS WHERE
WE'VE GOTTEN REPORTS
ABOUT AIRBENDERS.
IT LOOKS LIKE WE CAN HIT UP
MOST OF THEM
BEFORE WE GET TO BA SING SE.
 WE'RE GOING TO BRING
THE AIR NATION
BACK FROM THE BRINK
OF EXTINCTION
AFTER NEARLY 200 YEARS.
 AND IT'S ALL
"BECAUSE OF YOU, KORRA."
" FINALLY, OUR SHIFT CHANGE"
IS HERE.
" HEY, WHERE ARE"
THE OTHER GUARDS?
ZAHEER?
 AAH!
 IT'S NICE TO
"SEE YOU AGAIN, GHAZAN."
 THANKS FOR BUSTING ME OUT.
WHERE'D YOU PICK UP
THE NEW SKILLS?
 I HAVE HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
TO THANK FOR THAT.
I WAS GIVEN A GIFT.
I BELIEVE IT'S A SIGN THAT
OUR PATH IS A RIGHTEOUS ONE.
" AVATAR KORRA,"
"OH, IT IS SUCH AN HONOR"
TO HAVE YOU COME
TO OUR HUMBLE VILLAGE.
 THANKS.
 I HATE TO GET DOWN
"TO BUSINESS,"
BUT IS THE AIRBENDER HERE NOW?
 KUON AND HIS FAMILY
WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY
FOR A SPECIAL DINNER.
"PLEASE, RIGHT THIS WAY."
KUON HAS BEEN THE TALK
OF THE TOWN
EVER SINCE HE GOT AIRBENDING.
HE'S LIKE A LOCAL CELEBRITY.
 I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT IT'S AN HONOR
TO MEET A FELLOW AIRBENDER.
" OH, I STILL JUST THINK"
OF MYSELF
AS A SIMPLE FARMER...
WHO CAN AIRBEND.
"OH, I'M SO SORRY."
I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL.
 NO WORRIES. I LOVE PIE.
AND SO DOES PABU.
" WELL, YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE"
THAN JUST A FARMER NOW.
HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
CHANGED EVERYTHING.
YOU REPRESENT THE FUTURE
OF A CULTURE
THAT IS BEING REBORN.
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP US
REBUILD THE AIR NATION.
 I'M GONNA DO WHAT NOW?
THE ONLY THING I'M PLANNING
TO REBUILD IS MY BARN.
 BUT YOU MUST COME WITH US
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
" WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT."
I HAVE A FAMILY AND A FARM.
 OF COURSE YOU CAN COME.
THIS IS OF
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE!
YOUR WIFE WILL UNDERSTAND.
" WAIT, WHAT?"
"NO, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND."
" DADDY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?"
WHY DOES THE BALD MAN
WANT TO TAKE YOU AWAY?
 NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE
"DADDY AWAY, SWEETHEART."
" ACTUALLY, THIS BALD MAN"
"DOES WANT TO TAKE HIM,"
BUT IT'S FOR AN IMPORTANT CAUSE.
"YOUR DAD IS AN AIRBENDER,"
AND HE SHOULD LEARN
ABOUT HIS CULTURE.
 I THINK THERE'S BEEN
SOME SORT OF MISUNDERSTANDING.
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.
"I MIGHT BE ABLE TO AIRBEND,"
BUT I'M NO AIR NOMAD!
I'M NO MONK!
" OKAY, UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST"
"HAVE SOME DESSERT, HUH?"
WHO'S UP FOR DESSERT?
" SIR, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,"
"YOU'RE AN AIRBENDER NOW,"
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF
CULTURE YOU MUST LEARN ABOUT.
SKILLS YOU MUST MASTER.
 YOU EXPECT ME TO ABANDON
MY ENTIRE LIFE? MY FAMILY?
"NO! NO, SIR!"
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU
AND I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT YOU LEAVE!
 IN MY HEAD I SAW THAT
PLAYING OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY.
 MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE STAYED AND TRIED HARDER
TO CONVINCE HIM TO JOIN US.
 OR WE COULD'VE THROWN HIM
INTO A POTATO SACK
AND FORCED HIM INTO THE SHIP.
 THAT'S HOW THEY GOT ME
TO JOIN THE UNITED FORCES.
" NO, WE CAN'T COERCE PEOPLE"
OR THROW THEM IN POTATO SACKS.
THEY MUST COME FREELY.
"BUT NOT TO WORRY,"
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OTHER AIRBENDERS OUT THERE
WHO WILL BE HAPPY
TO COME WITH US
ONCE THEY FIND OUT WHAT
THE AIR NATION'S ALL ABOUT.
"WHEN YOUR SON BECOMES A MASTER,"
HE'LL GET TATTOOS ALL
"OVER HIS BODY, JUST LIKE ME."
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
NUTRITIOUS THAN OUR VEGETARIAN DIET.
I CAN TELL THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
WEARING
OUR ANCIENT AIRBENDER ROBES.
THEY'RE VERY BREATHABLE.
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR
WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AGAIN
BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY.
YOU'LL GET TO SHAVE YOUR HEAD!
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WILL BE A GIANT BISON!
I REALLY THOUGHT
I HAD THAT LAST GUY.
WHO DOESN'T WANT A BISON
AS THEIR BEST FRIEND?
" IT'S OKAY, TENZIN."
I STILL WANT TO BE AN AIRBENDER.
" OKAY, WE'VE TRIED IT YOUR WAY,"
AND PEOPLE JUST DON'T
SEEM TO BE RESPONDING.
IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE TOUGH LOVE.
" OH, ARE YOU THE AVATAR?"
"WHEN MY SON GOT AIRBENDING,"
MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SO HAPPY.
WE THOUGHT THIS COULD OPEN
A LOT OF DOORS FOR HIM.
AND MAYBE HE COULD FINALLY
MOVE OUT OF THE BASEMENT.
 HOW OLD IS HE?
" HE'S 22, AND, YOU KNOW,"
STILL JUST FIGURING
HIS LIFE OUT.
" WELL, I HAVE"
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AIRBENDERS
TO JOIN US
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL!
I'LL GET HIM.
"RYU, GET UP HERE!"
" HI, I'M KORRA."
" SO, YOU'RE LIKE THE AVATAR"
OR SOMETHING? BIG DEAL.
" AH, I JUST"
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY...
" YEAH, I HEARD YOU"
"TALKING TO MY MOM,"
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED.
" WELL, YOU'RE"
GONNA BE INTERESTED!
"YOU'RE AN AIRBENDER NOW,"
AND YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
AS A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.
 WHATEVER.
I DIDN'T ASK TO BECOME
"AN AIRBENDER, YOU KNOW."
" WELL, I DIDN'T ASK"
"TO BE THE AVATAR,"
"BUT I AM, AND"
I'M FULFILLING MY DUTIES.
 SO? YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
" YES, I DO HAVE TO."
" NO, YOU DON'T."
" YES, I DO."
" NO, YOU DON'T."
" WELL, IF I DIDN'T EMBRACE"
"MY ROLE,"
THEN OUR ENTIRE WORLD
COULD BE THROWN INTO CHAOS.
THINK ABOUT THAT.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
 MAYBE.
" NO, IT'S NOT!"
 SO WHAT? WHO CARES?
 EVERYONE CARES!
 I DON'T CARE.
" YES, YOU DO!"
" NO, I DON'T."
" WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO CARE,"
"YOU LITTLE SLACKER,"
BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING WITH ME!
" STOP PULLING ON MY COLLAR,"
YOU'RE STRETCHING IT OUT.
"MOM, ARE YOU JUST"
GONNA LET HER TAKE ME?
 I THINK IT'S
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
JUST TRY IT FOR A WEEK
AND SEE HOW IT GOES.
 NO! LET ME GO!
 AAH!
 THAT'S IT!
" KORRA, ENOUGH!"
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
 SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SON.
 WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!
 LOOK OUT!
 AAH!
 OH!
 WHOA!
 I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOUR UGLY MUGS AGAIN.
" GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO,"
MING-HUA.
" I'M FLATTERED,"
YOU BUSTED ME OUT
BEFORE THAT GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS.
 WE'RE GETTING HER NEXT.
" WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD"
JUST GO TO BA SING SE
AND TRY OUR LUCK THERE.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I JUST THOUGHT
MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE EXCITED
ABOUT COMING WITH US.
" WELL, MAYBE YOU GOTTA"
DO MORE TO GET THEM EXCITED.
YOU NEED TO ADD
A LITTLE RAZZLE DAZZLE.
" YEAH, RAZZLE DAZZLE."
WE COULD PUT ON SOME SORT OF
AIRBENDING STREET PERFORMANCE.
 I WAS GOING TO SAY WE COULD
"COVER TENZIN'S ROBE IN SEQUINS,"
BUT THAT'S EVEN BETTER.
" IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,"
BUT IT MIGHT WORK.
 I'M WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT.
 YES! THAT IS THE KIND
OF ENTHUSIASM I LIKE TO HEAR.
"COME ONE, COME ALL"
AND WITNESS THE AMAZING AIRBENDERS!
AN AIRBENDING SHOW THAT WILL LEAVE
YOU BREATHLESS WITH WIND!
"FIRST UP,"
THE TATTOOED MASTER HIMSELF.
YOU KNOW HIM AS THE SON
OF AVATAR AANG.
HE SHAVES EVERY HAIR ON HIS HEAD
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
"IT'S THE ONE, THE ONLY GUY"
WITH AN ARROW POINTING
TO HIS NOSE...
TENZIN!
"NOW, NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
PLEASE BE QUIET.
I HAVE SOME SERIOUS NEWS.
WE'VE HEARD THAT
AN ESCAPED FIREBENDING CONVICT
HAS BEEN SPOTTED NEAR HERE.
"NOW, I DON'T WANT"
"TO PANIC ANYONE,"
BUT IF YOU SEE A FIREBENDER
WITH A RED SCARF...
 I SEE HIM. HE'S RIGHT THERE!
"I AM THE ESCAPED CONVICT,"
AND YOU WILL ALL REAP MY FIRE.
" OH, NO, WHO WILL HELP US?"
 I WILL!
WITH MY AIRBENDING SKILLS.
 WHOA! AAH!
OH! AAH! AAH!
HEY! LET ME GO!
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE REHEARSED!
KORRA!
" WITH THE POWER OF AIRBENDING,"
EVEN THIS BEAST CAN FLOAT
LIKE A FEATHER!
LOOK WHAT CAN BE DONE IN ONLY
A FEW SHORT WEEKS OF PRACTICE.
"NO, NO, DON'T WORRY, FOLKS,"
"SHE MIGHT BE YOUNG,"
BUT SHE IS IN FULL CONTROL.
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
IF YOU OR ANYONE
"YOU KNOW IS AN AIRBENDER,"
PLEASE SEND THEM OUR WAY.
MASTER TENZIN AND AVATAR KORRA
WOULD LOVE TO TEACH THEM
ALL THEY KNOW.
 HEY. HELLO.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
"FOR AIRBENDERS,"
YOU JUST FOUND ONE.
I WANT TO JOIN YOU GUYS.
 GET OUTTA TOWN!
 WE GOT OUR FIRST RECRUIT.
" JUST TO BE TOTALLY CLEAR,"
WE'RE GOING TO BE HEADING
"TO BA SING SE,"
THEN THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
TO LIVE AS NOMADS
AND REBUILD THE AIR NATION.
ALL THAT SOUND GOOD TO YOU?
" YEAH, BA SING SE,"
"REBUILD THE TEMPLE,"
AIR NOMAD WHADDYADO... I'M IN.
LET'S GO RIGHT NOW.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT.
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE IT...
"UH, AH..."
"REAL QUICK, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"
 KAI. SO WHEN DO WE HIT
THE ROAD?
" HANG ON A SECOND, KAI."
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU COME WITH US
WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.
 MY PARENTS ARE... GONE.
 YOU'RE AN ORPHAN?
 IT HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
MY HOMETOWN WAS RAIDED
"BY OUTLAWS,"
BUT MY PARENTS
FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THEM.
"I WAS SO SCARED,"
BUT THEY TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY.
THEY WOULD PROTECT ME.
AND THEY DID.
MY PARENTS SAVED ME
AND THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.
BUT THEY DIED IN THE FIGHT.
MOM AND POP MEANT
EVERYTHING TO ME.
THEY WERE MY WHOLE LIFE.
" EVER SINCE THEN,"
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN AND ON THE RUN.
THOSE SAME OUTLAWS
ARE STILL AFTER ME.
" WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE"
ON THE RUN ANYMORE.
"RIGHT, GUYS? TELL HIM."
 I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.
I KNOW WE COULD NEVER
"REPLACE THEM,"
BUT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.
 WE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE. COME ON.
" WHEN YOU BOARD THIS AIRSHIP,"
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE YOUR OLD LIFE
BEHIND AND START A NEW PATH.
THAT'S SOME BIG BROTHER ADVICE.
JUST THINK OF ME
AS YOUR BIG BROTHER.
" GUYS, I THINK WE GOT TROUBLE."
 RELEASE THE BOY
OR WE'LL TAKE HIM BY FORCE.
 THE OUTLAWS...
THEY'RE AFTER ME.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
 WE'RE NOT RUNNING FROM ANYONE.
"IF YOU WANT KAI,"
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME!
 YOUR DAYS OF HARASSING
AN INNOCENT BOY ARE OVER.
YOU OUTLAWS ARE GOING TO PRISON.
 OUTLAWS?
INNOCENT BOY?
I'M A SHERIFF
AND THESE ARE MY DEPUTIES.
AND THIS KID IS A THIEF.
WHATEVER HE TOLD YOU IS A LIE.
WE'VE BEEN CHASING HIM
FOR MONTHS.
 WHERE'S KAI?
 RIGHT HERE.
I FOUND HIM SLIPPING AWAY.
 I WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM.
 WITH YOUR SACK OF GOLD?
" I TOLD YOU,"
I FOUND THAT ON THE ROAD!
" ENOUGH WITH THE LIES, KID."
I WANT THE TRUTH.
" THE TRUTH IS, HE'S THE OUTLAW."
HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
AS AN ORPHAN
UNTIL HE GOT ADOPTED BY A REAL NICE
FAMILY ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.
AND HOW DID HE REPAY THEM?
BY TAKING THEIR
ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS.
WE'VE BEEN AFTER HIM EVER SINCE.
 IS THAT TRUE?
 THE PERSON WHO STOLE
THAT STUFF WAS THE OLD ME.
ONCE I GOT
"AIRBENDING, I CHANGED."
"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT,"
BUT I FEEL LIKE AIRBENDING
CHOSE ME FOR A REASON.
LIKE I'M A NEW PERSON.
I'M SORRY! PLEASE!
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.
 ARE YOU TAKING HIM
BACK TO THE ORPHANAGE?
 NO. HE'S HEADED TO JAIL.
 WAIT!
YOU GUYS GOT
THE FAMILY'S LIFE SAVINGS BACK.
NOW LET US TAKE KAI.
 DO YOU REALLY WANT
OUR FIRST NEW MEMBER
OF THE AIR NATION
TO BE A LIAR AND A THIEF?
 HE JUST NEEDS
"SOME GUIDANCE, TENZIN."
AND WHO BETTER TO GIVE IT
TO HIM THAN US?
 DO YOU WANT THIS KID OR NOT?
 YES. YOU CAN RELEASE
THE BOY INTO OUR CUSTODY.
 THANK YOU.
 DON'T MAKE ME REGRET IT.
 WELCOME TO
"THE FAMILY, LITTLE BRO."
" I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,"
I'M GOING TO BE
"WATCHING YOU, KID."
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE.
YOU DON'T HAVE ME FOOLED.
" WHOA, HEY, LIGHTEN UP."
I'M TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.
MAKING A CHANGE.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.
" HI, I'M JINORA."
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP
WITH AIRBENDING
I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT I KNOW.
 THANKS.
THAT'S REAL NICE OF YOU.
 JINORA! WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
 THEY CAME OUT
"OF NOWHERE. I'M SO SORRY, LORD ZUKO."
 HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?
 THEY CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE.
AND ZAHEER IS AN AIRBENDER NOW.
 NO! THIS CAN'T BE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
THE POWER THESE CRIMINALS POSSESS?
"INDIVIDUALLY, THEY CAN TAKE"
DOWN ANY BENDER.
"PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER,"
THEY COULD TAKE DOWN
THE ENTIRE WORLD.
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THEIR LEADER IS AN AIRBENDER?
 WE CAN TRACK THEM...
 WE DON'T NEED TO TRACK THEM.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.
NOTIFY THE NEW CHIEFS OF
THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE
THAT AN ATTACK ON
THEIR PRISON IS IMMINENT.
AND SEND WORD TO LIN BEIFONG
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
THE AVATAR MUST BE PROTECTED.
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
 TO STOP THEM.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 THE AIR NATION
HAS ITS FIRST RECRUIT.
TEAM AVATAR'S SEARCH
FOR NEW AIRBENDERS
IN THE EARTH KINGDOM
"LED THEM TO KAI,"
AN ORPHAN WITH A SHADY PAST.
"MEANWHILE, LORD ZUKO"
IS HOT ON THE TRAIL
OF THREE ESCAPED CRIMINALS
WHO POSE A GREAT THREAT
TO THE AVATAR.
"UNAWARE OF THE DANGER TO HER,"
KORRA CONTINUES HER MISSION
TO FIND MORE AIRBENDERS.
"NEXT STOP,"
THE WALLED CITY OF BA SING SE.
" LIGHT ON YOUR FEET,"
UNCLE BUMI.
"REMEMBER, YOU WANT TO"
BE QUICK AND EVASIVE.
" DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,"
LITTLE LADY.
"I'VE BEEN IN A SCRAP OR TWO,"
YOU KNOW.
"OH, YOU'RE JUST A YOUNGSTER,"
SO I'M GOING TO GO EASY ON YOU.
WOULDN'T WANT TO HURT A KID...
OH!
" UNCLE BUMI, YOU'VE GOT TO"
WORK ON YOUR STANCE CHANGES.
"KAI, THAT WAS JUST..."
REALLY GOOD.
" THANKS, JINORA."
YOU'RE A GREAT TEACHER.
 HMM. DID I DROP MY WALLET?
" GIVE ME THAT,"
YOU LITTLE THIEF!
 IT'S SO EXCITING TO BE ON A DIPLOMATIC
MISSION TO BA SING SE.
WHAT'S THE EARTH QUEEN LIKE?
" I'VE NEVER MET HER,"
BUT I'VE HEARD
SHE CAN BE QUITE... DEMANDING.
" THIS IS IT, MAKO! WE MADE IT!"
THIS IS WHERE DAD GREW UP!
"COME HERE, LOOK! LOOK!"
" OKAY, CALM DOWN. I'M LOOKING."
 I WONDER HOW MANY AIRBENDERS
ARE DOWN THERE.
UGH.
THE LOWER RING LOOKS TERRIBLE.
" YEAH, I CAN SMELL IT"
FROM HERE.
NO WONDER DAD LEFT.
" HELLO, MIDDLE RING!"
 WOW.
"NOW, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT."
" AVATAR KORRA, MASTER TENZIN,"
IT IS A PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU
AND YOUR PARTY
TO THE UPPER RING OF BA SING SE.
I'M GRAND SECRETARIAT GUN.
 THANK YOU.
" AHH, IT'S GOT"
THAT UPPER RING SMELL.
" OH, NO."
THE QUEEN HATES ANIMALS.
 WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM
OUT OF SIGHT.
" WELL, I CAN JUST STASH PABU"
IN MY SHIRT.
THESE TWO ARE GONNA BE
A LITTLE TOUGHER.
" COME WITH ME, HURRY."
I'LL TAKE YOU TO YOUR QUARTERS.
"NOW, WHEN YOU MEET THE QUEEN,"
MAKE SURE YOU BOW LOW ENOUGH.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
"AND DON'T LOOK HER IN THE EYE,"
SHE CAN'T STAND THAT.
"IF ANY FOOD IS SERVED,"
DON'T EAT BEFORE SHE EATS.
"OH, ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO TASTE"
"HER FOOD FIRST,"
"THEN SHE EATS, THEN YOU CAN EAT."
"BETTER YET, JUST DON'T EAT."
 SEEMS LIKE
AN AWFUL LOT OF RULES.
" OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA,"
AND I'M THE ONE
WHO GETS IN TROUBLE
"WHEN PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW THEM,"
"SO PLEASE, PLEASE, FOR MY SAKE,"
JUST TRY NOT TO UPSET
HER MAJESTY.
 HERE WE ARE.
" OOH, VERY SWANKY."
" NOW, GO IN"
AND MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE...
 HEY!
 AND KEEP THOSE ANIMALS
OUT OF SIGHT IN THE BACKYARD.
"AVATAR KORRA,"
"IF YOU'D FOLLOW ME,"
WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP
HER MAJESTY WAITING.
"YOUR MAJESTY,"
MAY I PRESENT AVATAR KORRA.
 YOU'RE RUINING THE KOI POND!
IT'S COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED
BY THE TOPIARIES!
"GUARDS, TAKE THAT BUFFOON AWAY"
AND GET ME SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING!
YOU! RIP EVERYTHING OUT
AND START OVER!
I AM SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS.
"SO, I FINALLY GET A VISIT"
FROM THE AVATAR.
"LET ME GUESS,"
YOU WANT SOMETHING.
" WELL, ACTUALLY, YOUR"
"MAJESTY, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD..."
 I HARDLY THINK YOU'RE IN A
POSITION TO ASK ME FOR FAVORS
AFTER EVERYTHING THE LAST AVATAR
DID TO THE EARTH KINGDOM.
HE AND FIRE LORD ZUKO
TOOK ADVANTAGE
"OF MY FATHER'S WEAKNESS,"
AND STOLE OUR LANDS
TO MAKE THEIR OWN LITTLE EMPIRE.
THE UNITED REPUBLIC
IS EARTH KINGDOM TERRITORY.
" WELL, I-I'M NOT SURE"
WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT THAT.
" NOT THAT YOU CARE,"
BUT WHAT'S LEFT OF MY KINGDOM
IS FALLING TO RUIN.
ROVING BANDS OF BARBARIANS
ARE RAIDING VILLAGES
"IN THE COUNTRYSIDE,"
"AND NOW, SOME OF MY SUBJECTS ARE"
REFUSING TO PAY THEIR TAXES.
 I'M VERY SORRY
"FOR YOUR TROUBLES,"
BUT ACTUALLY...
 THAT TOPIARY IS SUPPOSED TO BE
"AN EEL-SWAN, NOT A TURTLE-DUCK!"
" HEY, HAS ANYONE SEEN KAI?"
 KAI?
 KAI! LITTLE BRO?
 HE'S NOT OVER HERE.
 I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN HIM
SINCE WE LANDED.
 I KNEW THAT KID WAS NO GOOD.
HE WAS JUST WAITING
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
TO RUN AWAY AGAIN.
 WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.
 WHAT'S THE POINT?
HE OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US.
 BUT HE'S MY NEW
LITTLE BROTHER.
HE'S PROBABLY LOST AND SCARED.
" HE IS JUST A LITTLE BOY,"
AND HE'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY.
"BESIDES, HE'S THE ONLY"
AIRBENDER WE'VE RECRUITED SO FAR.
WE CAN'T LOSE HIM.
 FINE.
BOLIN AND I WILL FIND HIM.
 NO! TO YOUR LEFT!
YOUR OTHER LEFT!
DO YOU HAVE THESE PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR SERVANTS?
 I DON'T REALLY HAVE SERVANTS.
"BUT, YOUR MAJESTY,"
THE REASON FOR OUR VISIT
IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GATHER
ALL OF THE NEW AIRBENDERS
WHO ARE POPPING UP
"IN THE EARTH KINGDOM,"
AND WE'D LIKE YOUR HELP
FINDING THE ONES IN BA SING SE.
 AIRBENDERS IN BA SING SE?
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?
 BEFORE WE LEFT
"REPUBLIC CITY, WE GOT SOME REPORTS."
" HMM. WELL, BEFORE I EVEN"
"CONSIDER HELPING YOU,"
I'LL NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.
 OH. OF COURSE. WHAT IS IT?
 I HAVE A VAULT
FULL OF TAX MONEY
SITTING IN A TOWN SOUTH OF HERE.
BARBARIANS HAVE STOLEN
MY PAST TWO SHIPMENTS.
GO COLLECT MY MONEY
AND BRING IT BACK HERE.
" YES, YOUR MAJESTY."
 KAI! DID YOU GO FISHING?
YOU UNDER THE BRIDGE?
" HERE, SIR, LET ME HELP YOU."
" OH, THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN."
WHAT A STRANGE SUDDEN BREEZE.
" YEAH, THAT WAS REALLY WEIRD."
 THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
 KAI!
GET BACK HERE!
" KAI, IT'S US!"
MAKO AND BOLIN! YOUR NEW FAMILY!
"EXCUSE ME, PARDON ME."
"NO, NO, CARRY ON."
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING
RUNNING AROUND ROBBING PEOPLE?
 I WAS JUST PRACTICING
MY AIRBENDING.
" YEAH, RIGHT. LET'S GO."
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.
HEY!
"YOUR LITTLE BROTHER, HUH?"
" YEAH, JUST A LOVABLE"
"LITTLE SCAMP, ISN'T HE?"
 REMINDS ME
OF MY LITTLE BROTHER.
 THIS IS THE EXPRESS LINE
TO THE LOWER RING.
"NEXT STOP, PO KONG STATION."
 AH!
 OH!
" ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN CATCH A"
TRAIN BACK TO THE UPPER RING.
 PASSPORTS AND TICKETS.
" WE CAN PAY, HOLD ON."
WHERE'S MY MONEY?
NO. KAI WOULDN'T...
"AW, MAN!"
" ALL RIGHT, BEAT IT, YOU TWO,"
BEFORE THINGS GET UGLY.
" AH, HEY!"
"THE BAD NEWS IS,"
WE'RE STUCK HERE.
"THE GOOD NEWS IS,"
YOU CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM
WHEREVER YOU WANT.
 ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE
TO COLLECT THE TAX MONEY?
 THERE ARE ROYAL GUARDS
WAITING AT THE VAULT.
I DOUBT ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN.
I THINK HER MAJESTY JUST LIKES
ORDERING ME AROUND.
MAN.
"OH, I THINK I SLIPPED A DISC"
SLEEPING HERE.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
WE SPENT THE NIGHT ON A TRASH PILE.
IT'S ABOUT HOW I REMEMBERED.
 I BET EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT
THAT WE'VE BEEN GONE ALL NIGHT.
 I'M WORRIED ABOUT KAI.
HE'S JUST A LITTLE KID
OUT THERE ON HIS OWN.
HE'S PROBABLY REALLY SCARED.
" YOUR BREAKFAST, MASTER FUNG."
 KEEP THE CHANGE.
I LOVE BA SING SE.
" WHEW, I'M GETTING HUNGRY."
WE MIGHT HAVE TO
HUSTLE UP A LITTLE BREAKFAST
WITH THE OLD FRUIT STAND SCAM.
COME ON.
YOU REMEMBER HOW IT GOES.
"I PUSH YOU INTO THE STAND,"
"YOU SCREAM, I PRETEND TO FAINT."
 I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS.
"BESIDES, LOOK AT THIS FRUIT."
IT'S DISGUSTING.
WE DON'T WANT TO STEAL THIS.
" HEY, YOU TRYING"
TO STEAL MY FRUIT?
" NO, I JUST SAID I DON'T WANT"
ANY OF THIS ROTTEN FRUIT.
" OH, YOU TOO GOOD FOR MY FRUIT?"
THIS IS THE BEST FRUIT
ON THE BLOCK.
 SO YOU WANT ME TO STEAL IT?
" JUST TRY IT, BUDDY.GO AHEAD."
 I'M CONFUSED.
ARE WE STEALING
THE FRUIT OR NOT?
" I KNEW IT, THIEVES!"
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
" DAD, THESE FRUIT THIEVES"
ARE INSULTING OUR FRUIT.
 BOLIN? MAKO?
 HOW DO YOU KNOW OUR NAMES?
" YEAH, I MEAN,"
"I'M FAMOUS, SO I GET THAT,"
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?
 YOU LOOK JUST LIKE SAN.
"TU, YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE"
WHO THESE GUYS ARE.
"THEY'RE YOUR COUSINS,"
MY BROTHER SAN'S KIDS.
" LORD ZUKO, UNCLE."
THIS IS A SURPRISE.
 FINALLY SOMETHING
INTERESTING HAPPENS.
RULING THE TRIBE IS SO TEDIOUS.
 THEN YOU SHOULD ENJOY THIS.
WE NEED TO CHECK
ON A SECRET ICE PRISON
IN THE WESTERN TUNDRA.
 YOUR FATHER SENT US A LETTER
"YEARS AGO WITH YOUR NAMES,"
BUT THAT WAS THE LAST
WE HEARD FROM HIM.
THEN WE SAW YOUR PICTURES
IN THE SPORTS PAGES
WITH YOUR BENDING TEAM.
"AND BOLIN,"
WE LOVE THOSE NUKTUK MOVERS.
THEY'RE HILARIOUS.
" YEAH, THEY'RE NOT REALLY"
"COMEDIES, BUT, UH..."
" YEAH, I COULD PROBABLY"
"BE A PRO-BENDER,"
"OR AN ACTOR, OR SOMETHING"
IF I LIVED IN A MANSION
IN REPUBLIC CITY LIKE YOU GUYS.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
HERE ON THE STREETS.
YOU GOTTA BE TOUGH.
" OH, MAKO AND I GREW UP"
ON THE STREETS.
"WE WERE HOMELESS,"
"THEN WE WERE KIND OF IN A GANG,"
THEN WE LIVED IN A GYM.
" HEY, EVERYBODY!"
LOOK WHO'S HERE!
"SAN'S KIDS, MAKO AND BOLIN!"
 NO WAY.
 COME IN.
 WELCOME.
 IS IT TRUE?
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?
" BOYS, THIS IS"
"YOUR GRANDMOTHER, YIN."
" OH, IT IS SO WONDERFUL"
TO FINALLY MEET
MY LONG-LOST GRANDCHILDREN.
WHERE IS SAN AND YOUR MOTHER?
" WAIT, YOU MEAN,"
YOU DON'T KNOW?
 I'M SORRY.
THEY WERE KILLED
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE.
 I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS.
LET'S HURRY UP
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
 YOU HERE TO PICK UP
THE TAX SHIPMENT?
 GO AHEAD AND LOAD IT
ON THE AIRSHIP.
 SO MUCH FOR OUR ESCORTS.
 MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE BROUGHT
EVERYBODY ELSE.
" STEP AWAY FROM THE GOLD,"
"LADIES, AND YOU WON'T GET HURT."
" SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,"
BUT WE'RE TAKING THIS GOLD
BACK TO BA SING SE.
" AW, WE LOVE GALS WITH SPIRIT."
SUIT YOURSELF.
 AAH!
OH!
RETREAT! RETREAT!
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE
"OF THIS FIGHT, AVATAR!"
THAT GOLD BELONGS
"TO THE PEOPLE, NOT THE QUEEN!"
 WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
HE'S RIGHT?
 WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL US
WE HAVE A SECRET PRISON
WE COULD HAVE BEEN
THROWING PEOPLE IN?
 I'D LIKE TO PUT MY TAILOR
IN HERE.
HE NEVER GETS MY CUFFS RIGHT.
THEY'RE SO CREASY.
 WE BUILT THIS PLACE SECRETLY
WITH YOUR FATHER
TO HOLD A VERY SPECIAL PRISONER.
SHE'S A POWERFUL FIREBENDER
NAMED P'LI
WHO CAN CREATE EXPLOSIONS
WITH HER MIND.
"IRONICALLY, I HIRED A GUY"
WITH A SIMILAR ABILITY
TO KILL THE AVATAR MYSELF ONCE.
DIDN'T WORK.
 DON'T FEEL BAD.
I TRIED TO KILL KORRA
AFTER SHE RUINED MY WEDDING.
IT HAPPENS.
 LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON KEEPING THIS WOMAN IN PRISON.
 THE INTENSE COLD
PREVENTS HER FROM FIREBENDING.
 THERE'S CERTAINLY NO WAY
ANYONE'S BREAKING OUT OF HERE.
 THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT
ABOUT THE OTHER THREE PRISONS.
MUST BE SOMETHING
EXCITING GOING ON.
NO ONE INTERESTING
HAS VISITED ME IN 13 YEARS.
 DON'T GET USED TO IT.
" HE'S OUT, ISN'T HE?"
"MMM, I'M FEELING WARMER ALREADY."
 THIS IS SO GREAT.
WE'VE NEVER HAD A FAMILY BEFORE.
"NOW WE'VE GOT... 1, 2, 5, 11..."
A BIG FAMILY! YEAH!
 SO WHY DID DAD LEAVE
BA SING SE?
" OH, HE ALWAYS HAD BIG DREAMS."
HE COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT
AND SEE THE WORLD.
YOUR GRANDFATHER THOUGHT
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.
HE WANTED SAN TO STAY HOME
"AND WORK THE FRUIT STAND,"
"BUT SAN WAS DETERMINED TO LEAVE,"
AND THEY HAD A HUGE FIGHT.
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
THEY EVER SPOKE.
"OH, UM, SORRY, MOM."
 COME WITH ME.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.
THIS IS THE ONLY LETTER
WE EVER GOT FROM SAN.
IT SAYS HE MARRIED
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
FROM THE FIRE NATION
AND HAD TWO WONDERFUL SONS.
HE SENT THIS PICTURE
OF YOU ALL ON HIS BIRTHDAY.
" LOOK, MAKO."
DAD'S WEARING YOUR SCARF.
 I'M SO SAD THAT I NEVER
"GOT TO MEET YOUR MOTHER,"
BUT YOU HAVE HER EYES.
I KNOW FROM LOOKING AT YOU TWO
THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
A WONDERFUL BRIDE FOR MY BOY.
 I'M SURE THEY WOULD
WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.
" YOUR MAJESTY, THE AVATAR HAS"
RETURNED WITH THE TAX PAYMENTS.
 FINALLY.
SECURE IT IN THE VAULT.
 IT'S BEING DONE AS WE SPEAK.
" SO NOW, YOUR MAJESTY,"
IF I COULD START MEETING
SOME OF THE AIRBENDERS
HERE IN THE CITY.
 THE DAI LI THOROUGHLY
"SEARCHED THE CITY,"
BUT IT SEEMS YOUR REPORTS
WERE INCORRECT.
THERE ARE NO AIRBENDERS
IN BA SING SE.
SO YOU CAN GATHER
YOUR LITTLE BAND
AND BE ON YOUR WAY TOMORROW.
 YOU MAKE ME DO YOUR DIRTY WORK
EXTORTING YOUR OWN CITIZENS
FOR YOUR STUPID PALACES
"AND TOPIARIES,"
AND THEN YOU JUST WANT
TO SEND ME AWAY?
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL WE FIND SOME AIRBENDERS!
WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME HERE!
 GET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT!
 THIS ISN'T OVER!
I'M GOING TO FIND
THE AIRBENDERS!
" YOU KNOW, SAN WOULD HAVE"
BEEN SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS.
TRAVELING THE WORLD
"WITH THE AVATAR,"
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED THAT.
 WE ACTUALLY NEED TO GET BACK TO THE
AVATAR IN THE UPPER RING.
 WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HELPING HER FIND AIRBENDERS
IN BA SING SE.
 WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?
 ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS STARTED
AIRBENDING ABOUT A WEEK AGO.
"A COUPLE DAYS LATER,"
TWO DAI LI AGENTS
COME OUT OF NOWHERE
AND SNATCH HIM UP.
NO ONE'S SEEN HIM SINCE.
 THEY SAY THE EARTH QUEEN'S LOCKING
ALL THE AIRBENDERS UP SOMEWHERE
AND USING THEM FOR EXPERIMENTS.
 TU! DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
ABOUT HER MAJESTY.
LONG MAY SHE REIGN.
 WE HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE UPPER RING AND TELL KORRA.
 I HOPE KAI IS OKAY.
" HERE SIR, LET ME HELP YOU."
HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
I'M WITH THE AVATAR!
" WELCOME TO HER MAJESTY'S ARMY,"
FIRST AIRBENDING REGIMENT.
"FROM NOW ON,"
YOU LIVE TO FIGHT FOR THE EARTH QUEEN.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 AIRBENDERS ARE
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARING
"IN BA SING SE, INCLUDING KAI."
THE EARTH QUEEN DENIED ANY
"KNOWLEDGE OF THE AIRBENDERS,"
BUT KORRA REFUSED
TO GIVE UP HER SEARCH.
"MEANWHILE, MAKO AND BOLIN"
"MET THEIR LONG-LOST RELATIVES,"
WHO TOLD THEM THAT DAI LI AGENTS
HAVE BEEN ROUNDING UP
AIRBENDERS FOR THE QUEEN'S ARMY.
"AND AT A PRISON IN THE NORTH,"
TONRAQ AND LORD ZUKO PREPARE
FOR ZAHEER'S IMMINENT ATTACK.
 DID YOU SEE ZAHEER?
 THE ONLY THING I SAW
WAS A SNOWSTORM HEADING OUR WAY.
 THAT'S NOT A SNOWSTORM.
THAT'S HIM.
"I PUT YOU AWAY ONCE, ZAHEER,"
AND I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.
 MING-HUA.
 LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
 WE COULD HAVE JUST TAKEN
"THE ELEVATOR, SHOW-OFF."
I'VE WAITED 13 YEARS
TO FEEL THIS WARM.
 I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.
 I NEVER DOUBTED.
 REALLY? RIGHT NOW?
 I GOT 'EM!
THESE PASSPORTS SHOULD GET YOU
INTO THE UPPER RING.
" AWESOME! TU, YOU'RE THE BEST"
COUSIN A GUY COULD HAVE.
AND MY OTHER COUSINS AS WELL.
"YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE ALL THE BEST."
 THANKS.
I KNOW THIS WASN'T EASY.
 IT'S SUCH A SHAME
YOU TWO MUST LEAVE SO SOON.
 I WISH WE COULD STAY.
BUT IF IT'S TRUE THE EARTH QUEEN
IS FORCING AIRBENDERS
"INTO HER ARMY,"
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.
 I LOVE YOU BOTH.
COME VISIT AGAIN.
" WE WILL, GRANDMA."
" I LOVE YOU TOO, GRANDMA."
AND CHOW AND TU
AND MENG-MENG AND CHOW JR.
"AND THERE HE IS,"
"BIG TEE AND LITTLE... LITTLE TEE,"
AND MEDIUM YU AND... AND...
AND WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?
I KNOW THAT EARTH QUEEN
IS LYING TO ME.
I CAN TELL BY THAT STUPID
LITTLE QUEENY SMIRK OF HERS!
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HELPED HER.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
SHE WAS USING ME!
 WHOA! HEY!
I THINK I COULD USE A BREAK.
YOU LETTING OFF STEAM
IS STARTING TO...
HURT... A LOT.
 SORRY.
MAKO! BOLIN!
YOU'RE OKAY.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
 WE CHASED KAI...
TRAIN... SLIPPED AWAY...
LOWER RING...
SLEPT IN TRASH PILE...
MET OUR FAMILY...
"GRANDMA, TEARS... MAKO SCARF..."
EARTH QUEEN LYING.
MM.
 CAN YOU INTERPRET THAT?
 THE EARTH QUEEN'S BEEN
SECRETLY TAKING AIRBENDERS
AND FORCING THEM INTO HER ARMY.
 SHE WAS LYING. I KNEW IT!
"I SWEAR,"
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HER...
 IT'S THE QUEEN.
" QUICK, PABU, SHIRT!"
I KNOW. SORRY. KINDA SWEATY.
" GOOD, YOU'RE HERE."
"GUN, TELL HER THE NEWS."
 WE'VE RECEIVED WORD
FROM THE YANG PROVINCE.
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS
OF AIRBENDERS THERE.
" WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?"
IT'S THE VERY THING
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
 THANK YOU.
THAT IS JUST
"THE MOST WONDERFUL NEWS, EVER."
Y AY.
 SO I ASSUME YOU AND YOUR...
FRIENDS HERE
WILL BE LEAVING IMMEDIATELY.
"AHHH, AH-CHOO!"
AH-CHOO!
"AHHHH, AH-CHOO!"
IS THERE AN ANIMAL
IN MY PRESENCE?
" NO, YOUR MAJESTY."
I WOULD NEVER ALLOW
AN ANIMAL NEAR YOU.
" AH-CHOO! AHH, AHH, AH-CHOO!"
IF I FIND ONE WITHIN
"50 FEET OF ME,"
IT'S YOUR HEAD!
"ANYWAY, IF YOU NEED"
"ANY ASSISTANCE PACKING,"
LET GUN KNOW.
HE'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU ARE
ON YOUR WAY BY EVENING.
" UH, THIS EVENING?"
I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT LEAVING SO SOON.
 BECAUSE OUR AIRSHIP
IS HAVING ENGINE TROUBLE.
IT'LL TAKE ME UNTIL TOMORROW
TO FINISH THE REPAIRS.
" AHH, AHH, AH-CHOO! AH-CHOO!"
AH-CHOO!
 THANKS FOR BUYING US
SOME TIME.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE EARTH QUEEN
IS CONSCRIPTING AIRBENDERS.
 THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT
BE FORCED TO JOIN AN ARMY.
" WELL, TECHNICALLY,"
THE EARTH QUEEN HAS A RIGHT
TO CONSCRIPT HER CITIZENS.
WHAT? IT'S TRUE.
" GUYS, WHAT IF KAI"
WAS SPOTTED AIRBENDING?
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOO.
 PROBABLY NOT.
HE'S SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT
TO CATCH.
LIKE A... LIKE A LITTLE
GREASED HOG-MONKEY.
 BUT WHAT IF HE WAS?
" DON'T WORRY, JINORA."
WE'LL FIND HIM.
WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO LOOK.
 I BET
THEY'RE UNDER LAKE LAOGAI.
WHAT? I'VE BEEN READING
SOME OF JINORA'S BOOKS.
THE OLD DAI LI AGENTS
USED TO HAVE A SECRET FORTRESS
BENEATH THE LAKE.
 MAKO'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE PERFECT SPOT
TO HIDE AIRBENDERS.
AND I KNOW HOW TO CHECK IT OUT
WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT.
I CAN PROJECT MY SPIRIT INTO IT.
 YOU MEAN
THAT OUT-OF-BODY THING YOU DID
TO HELP GIANT SPIRITY-KORRA?
 YOU CAN STILL DO THAT?
 IT'S NOT AS POWERFUL AS IT WAS
"DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,"
"BUT IF I CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH,"
I THINK I CAN DO IT.
 LET'S GO GET KAI OUT.
LET'S GET
ALL THE AIRBENDERS OUT.
 YOU ARE THE PROPERTY
OF THE EARTH KINGDOM.
YOU WILL BECOME THE EARTH
QUEEN'S ELITE FIGHTING FORCE
AND PROTECT HER AT ALL COST.
IT IS YOUR DUTY
TO SERVE THE EARTH QUEEN.
 AAH!
 GO EASY ON ME.
I'M NOT THAT GOOD.
 NEVER SHOW MERCY!
"NOW ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT,"
"AND THIS TIME, LIKE YOU MEAN IT."
 SORRY.
 A SOLDIER NEVER APOLOGIZES
TO HIS ENEMY.
 I'M NOT A SOLDIER.
 YOU WILL BE
WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.
" IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,"
COME BACK IMMEDIATELY.
 I WILL.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
 THE AIRBENDERS AREN'T THERE.
IT'S COMPLETELY DESERTED.
 THEY'RE NOT DOWN THERE?
" JINORA, YOU'VE READ"
ALL ABOUT BA SING SE.
CAN YOU THINK
OF ANY OTHER PLACES
THE AIRBENDERS MIGHT BE?
 I GUESS THEY COULD BE
IN THE CATACOMBS
BENEATH THE UPPER RING
OR THE ANCIENT SEWERS
BENEATH THE LOWER RING
OR THE MAZE OF TUNNELS THAT
"CONNECTS THE RINGS TOGETHER,"
OR THEY COULD BE...
THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY PLACES.
THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER WAY TO LOCATE THEM.
 MAYBE THERE IS.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE?
 I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST KIND OF FOCUSED
ON YOUR ENERGY.
I THINK OUR
SPIRITUAL CONNECTION LED ME TO YOU.
 MAYBE YOU CAN FIND KAI
THE SAME WAY.
I KNOW YOU TWO
HAVE A CONNECTION.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN A CONNECTION?
 I DON'T KNOW. LET ME TRY.
 UGH!
 UGH!
THANKS.
 YOU AGAIN!
IF YOU HAVE TIME
"TO HELP YOUR FRIEND,"
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ENOUGH ROCKS FOR YOURSELF.
 I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT.
THROW HIM IN THE HOLE!
JINORA?
 IT WORKED!
 HOW ARE YOU HERE RIGHT NOW?
" SHH, QUIET."
IT'S A HIGH-LEVEL
AIRBENDER MOVE...
WITH A LITTLE SPIRITUAL STUFF
THROWN IN.
"FOR A SECOND THERE,"
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GHOST.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
AND THE OTHER AIRBENDERS.
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU ALL
OUT OF HERE.
WHERE ARE WE ANYWAY?
 UNDERGROUND SOMEWHERE.
"OTHER THAN THAT,"
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
 I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
DON'T WORRY.
 JINORA... THANKS.
 THE EARTH QUEEN'S TEMPLE.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE
MISS QUEENY SMUGFACE
HAD THEM RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES
THE WHOLE TIME!
 WE HAVE TO GET
INTO THAT COMPOUND TONIGHT
AND GET THOSE AIRBENDERS OUT.
" ALL RIGHT, WE GO IN"
UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS.
TWO SMALL INSERTION TEAMS
AND A THIRD ON THE OUTSIDE.
THEN ALL WE'LL NEED
"IS 12 TONS OF BLASTING JELLY,"
A MEDIUM-SIZED BULLDOZER AND...
DOES ANYONE HAVE A BADGER-MOLE
THAT KNOWS MORSE CODE?
" OH, GREAT."
NOT THE QUEEN AGAIN.
 EVERYONE ACT NORMAL.
"AND, BOLIN..."
 I'M ON IT!
WHAT?
"HEY, I'M NOT SWEATY THIS TIME."
AH!
 LIN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 WE NEED TO GET KORRA
OUT OF HERE IMMEDIATELY.
HER LIFE'S IN DANGER.
 WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 I JUST GOT WORD
FROM LORD ZUKO AND TONRAQ.
 WHY IS LORD ZUKO WITH MY DAD?
 ZAHEER AND THE OTHERS
HAVE ESCAPED.
 HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
 BECAUSE ZAHEER
IS AN AIRBENDER NOW.
 NO.
" ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON."
WILL YOU QUIT IGNORING ME
AND TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO'S ZAHEER?
WHY IS MY LIFE IN DANGER?
 SHORTLY AFTER WE FOUND OUT
"YOU WERE THE AVATAR,"
ZAHEER AND THREE OTHERS
ATTEMPTED TO KIDNAP YOU.
"LUCKILY, YOUR FATHER,"
"LORD ZUKO, CHIEF SOKKA,"
AND I WERE THERE TO STOP THEM.
WE APPREHENDED THE CRIMINALS AND
LOCKED THEM AWAY IN PRISONS
DESIGNED TO IMPAIR
THEIR ABILITIES.
 SO THAT'S WHY YOU AND MY DAD
SHELTERED ME AWAY.
 IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
 WHY WERE THEY TRYING
TO KIDNAP KORRA?
 WE SPENT 13 YEARS
"INTERROGATING THEM,"
BUT THEY NEVER BROKE.
"TO THIS DAY, NO ONE KNOWS"
WHAT THEIR MOTIVE WAS.
NOW WE NEED TO GET YOU BACK
"TO REPUBLIC CITY,"
WHERE I CAN PROTECT YOU.
" NO, I'M NOT RUNNING."
" KORRA, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND."
THESE CRIMINALS ARE LIKE
NOTHING YOU'VE EVER FACED BEFORE.
" LOOK, I'M NOT"
A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO PROTECT ME.
I CAME HERE FOR ONE THING...
TO FIND AIRBENDERS...
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT THEM.
" FINE, LET'S GET 'EM"
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
" IN A MILITARY COMPOUND,"
AND WE'RE BUSTING THEM OUT.
 HI.
 HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
" AW, IT'S JUST"
THAT LITTLE AIRBENDER GIRL
WHO CAME WITH THE AVATAR.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WALKING
AROUND HERE ALL ALONE.
 I'M NOT ALONE.
" BUMI AND KORRA,"
YOU TWO WILL COME WITH ME
TO FIND THE AIRBENDERS.
YOU THREE FIND KAI.
WE'LL MEET
ON THE SURFACE SHORTLY.
RADIO US IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.
 WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO ARE YOU?
" I'M THE AVATAR,"
AND I'M GETTING YOU ALL
OUT OF HERE.
 WE'RE LEAVING?
 WHERE ARE WE GOING?
" EVERYONE, PLEASE,"
YOU MUST STAY CALM AND QUIET
IF WE WANT THIS TO WORK.
 WHAT TO WORK?
WE'RE SNEAKING OUT?
" YES, AND WE MUST LEAVE NOW."
 WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU AWAY FROM
THE EARTH QUEEN AND OUT OF THE CITY.
 THERE'S AN AIRBENDER
THAT'S NOT HERE.
HIS NAME IS KAI.
WE NEED TO GET HIM.
 WE'RE ALREADY
TAKING CARE OF IT.
" TOPSIDE, THIS IS PAPA BEAR."
THE BREEZIES ARE IN THE HOLD.
CUE THE BALLOONS.
 WHAT?
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
 NO!
"WE GOT THE AIRBENDERS,"
AND WE'RE HEADED OUT.
BRING THE AIRSHIPS.
NO ONE LIKES CODE NAMES ANYMORE.
 COPY THAT.
ASAMI AND I ARE ON OUR WAY.
" COME ON,"
WE'RE GETTING YOU OUT.
 KAI!
MWAH!
 WHOA!
TENZIN'S NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS.
 THEN DON'T TELL HIM.
 HOW CAN I NOT?
THIS IS TOO JUICY!
 THANKS FOR COMING TO GET ME.
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT STEALING YOUR WALLETS
AND RUNNING AWAY
AND GETTING YOU STUCK
ON THAT TRAIN.
" OH, WE CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU!"
" YES, WE CAN."
I HAD A LOT OF MONEY
IN THAT WALLET!
" GUYS, COME ON."
 DESERTING HER MAJESTY'S
"ARMY IS HIGH TREASON,"
PUNISHABLE BY DEATH.
" COME ON, IT'S CLEAR."
 SO YOU'VE DISCOVERED
MY ELITE ARMY.
I SEE THEIR LOYALTY
STILL NEEDS SOME WORK.
 THESE AIRBENDERS
SHOULDN'T BE USED AS WEAPONS.
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE
THEIR OWN PATHS.
 THESE AIRBENDERS
"ARE EARTH KINGDOM CITIZENS,"
AND I AM THEIR QUEEN.
TAKING THEM WILL CONSTITUTE
AN ACT OF WAR.
"IF YOU DISOBEY ME,"
I WILL BEAR DOWN ON YOU
WITH THE ENTIRE FORCE
OF MY KINGDOM!
 THEY'RE LEAVING WITH ME.
" NO, THEY'RE NOT!"
 I GUESS I AM AS GOOD
AS I THOUGHT.
 EVERYONE'S IN. LET'S GO!
OOGI!
 TAKE DOWN THOSE AIRSHIPS!
 WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?
 WE NEED HELP!
"EVERYBODY, HANG ON!"
" WHOA, THAT WAS AWESOME!"
 BRING ME THOSE AIRSHIPS NOW!
"AHH, AH-CHOO!"
"OH, GET IT OFF ME! AH-CHOO!"
GET THIS FUR OFF... AHHH-CHOO!
 I KNOW THAT NONE OF YOU
"CHOSE TO BECOME AIRBENDERS,"
BUT NOW YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE.
WE CAN RELOCATE YOU
"SOMEWHERE SAFE,"
OR YOU CAN COME WITH ME
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
TO LIVE IN PEACE
AND TRAIN AS AIR NOMADS.
YOU ARE NO LONGER
ANYONE'S PROPERTY.
WHAT PATH YOU DECIDE
IS UP TO YOU.
 I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.
 ME TOO.
 COUNT ME IN.
 I WANNA GO TOO.
 I'LL GO TOO.
 ME TOO.
 SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
 I WANNA GO TOO.
" OOH, I WANNA GO."
 GOOD LUCK
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
I'LL SEND MORE AIRBENDERS
YOUR WAY WHEN I FIND THEM.
" BE CAREFUL OUT THERE,"
AND STAY SAFE.
 I'LL TRY.
"IT SEEMS LIKE WHEREVER I GO,"
I MAKE A NEW ENEMY.
 BUT YOU MADE
SOME NEW FRIENDS TOO.
"YOU DID WELL, KORRA."
 THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 IS THERE ANY PLACE SAFE
FOR THE AVATAR?
"FIRST, PRESIDENT RAIKO"
BANISHED HER FROM REPUBLIC CITY.
THEN THE EARTH QUEEN DECLARED
HER AN ENEMY OF THE KINGDOM
AFTER KORRA RESCUED A GROUP
OF AIRBENDERS FROM BA SING SE.
AND NOW KORRA
HAS LEARNED THAT ZAHEER
AND HIS FELLOW CRIMINALS
ARE AFTER HER.
WITH TENZIN BUSY BRINGING
THE NEW RECRUITS
"TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE,"
KORRA'S PROTECTION NOW RESTS
IN BEIFONG'S HANDS.
" WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING FETCH,"
FOUR OF THE MOST DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS IN THE WORLD
ARE HUNTING YOU DOWN.
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.
 RELAX. WE JUST GOT HERE.
"BESIDES, NO ONE KNOWS"
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW EXCEPT US.
I THINK SHE WANTS YOU
TO THROW IT FOR HER.
 I'LL PASS. THANKS.
 WE JUST GOT A CALL ON THE
RADIO ABOUT ANOTHER AIRBENDER.
 FINALLY. WHERE ARE THEY?
" A CITY CALLED ZAOFU,"
THE HOME OF THE METAL CLAN.
 YOU KNOW THE PLACE?
" UH, NEVER BEEN, BUT"
I DON'T WANT YOU GOING THERE.
I'D REST A LOT EASIER
IF YOU WERE BACK SAFE IN REPUBLIC CITY.
" SORRY, BUT IF THERE'S"
"AN AIRBENDER IN ZAOFU,"
THEN THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GOING NEXT.
"WOW, WOW, WOW!"
"AN ENTIRE CITY MADE OF METAL,"
WHOO!
YOU SHOULD BE
"RIGHT AT HOME, BEIFONG."
 HMM.
 YEAH!
 AREN'T YOU COMING?
 WHAT'S THERE TO SEE?
IT'S METAL. BIG WHOOP.
"JUST FIND THE AIRBENDER,"
AND LET'S GET MOVING.
AND DON'T TELL ANYONE I'M HERE.
 WHY NOT?
 I DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU.
JUST DO WHAT I SAY.
 FINE.
"YOU GOT IT, CHIEF CRANKY PANTS."
" AVATAR KORRA,"
IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.
MY NAME IS AIWEI.
 THANKS FOR HAVING US.
 IS THIS EVERYONE?
" YEP, JUST US."
SO CAN I MEET THE NEW AIRBENDER?
 OF COURSE. RIGHT THIS WAY.
 AND THIS IS
"THE AIR ACOLYTE DINING HALL,"
"WHERE EVERYONE EATS,"
AND THIS IS DAW.
"HE'S A NEW AIRBENDER TOO,"
LIKE YOU GUYS.
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW EXCITING. NEW FRIENDS.
" EXCUSE ME, HELLO?"
MY NAME IS YORRU.
I HEARD THIS WAS THE PLACE TO
COME IF YOU'RE A NEW AIRBENDER.
" YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, STRANGER."
" WELL, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,"
"I WOKE UP, AND SUDDENLY,"
I COULD DO THIS.
" MOM, AUNT KYA,"
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE!
 THAT STATUE HONORS
"THE FIRST METALBENDER,"
"TOPH BEIFONG, WHO EXPANDED"
THE POSSIBILITIES
OF WHAT BENDERS WERE CAPABLE OF.
"HERE, EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED"
TO REACH
HIS OR HER HIGHEST POTENTIAL.
 DOES TOPH LIVE HERE?
ARE WE GOING TO GET TO MEET HER?
 I'M AFRAID NOT.
SHE USED TO VISIT
"FROM TIME TO TIME,"
"BUT YEARS AGO,"
SHE LEFT TO WANDER THE WORLD
IN SEARCH OF ENLIGHTENMENT.
NO ONE HAS SEEN HER SINCE.
" WOW, IS THIS"
WHERE THE AIRBENDER LIVES?
" YES, BUT FIRST,"
HER MOTHER WANTS TO MEET YOU.
 IS THIS SOME KIND
OF COMBAT TRAINING?
 NOT EXACTLY.
THEY ARE REHEARSING
FOR A DANCE PREMIERE NEXT MONTH.
" THAT'S IT FOR TODAY, EVERYONE."
 ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
THE MATRIARCH
"OF THE METAL CLAN, SUYIN."
" PLEASE, CALL ME SU."
"GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU,"
AVATAR KORRA.
AND THIS MUST BE
"MAKO, BOLIN, AND ASAMI."
 YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH.
 I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS
TO KNOW WHO'S VISITING MY CITY.
 SO YOU'RE A DANCER?
" DANCER, LEADER, WIFE, MOTHER,"
COLLECTOR OF RARE METEORITES.
YOU'LL FIND PEOPLE HERE
HAVE MANY SKILLS AND INTERESTS.
" KORRA, WHY DID YOU LIE"
WHEN AIWEI ASKED IF THERE WAS
ANYONE ELSE WITH YOU?
 WHAT? I-I DIDN'T.
I MEAN...
 HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS LYING?
 I AM A TRUTH SEER.
"WHEN PEOPLE LIE,"
THEIR HEART RATE
AND BREATHING INCREASE.
I CAN SENSE
THE MOST SUBTLE OF CHANGES.
"THANKS TO AIWEI,"
THERE ARE NO SECRETS IN OUR CITY.
 WE CAME WITH
REPUBLIC CITY'S CHIEF OF POLICE.
SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW SHE WAS HERE.
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.
 LIN'S HERE?
"WELL, I WOULD LOVE TO SAY HELLO."
" WAIT, YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?"
" YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?"
"OH, LIN NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT ME."
 NO. WHY WOULD SHE?
 I'M LIN'S SISTER.
I FOUND OUT WHY
YOU WERE SO AGAINST COMING HERE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME
YOU HAD A SISTER?
 HALF-SISTER.
" SAME MOM, DIFFERENT DADS."
"SO WHAT? WE'RE BLOOD, LIN."
"AND AFTER 30 YEARS, THE LEAST"
YOU COULD DO IS SAY HELLO.
 I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU.
YOU TWO HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN 30 YEARS... HOW COME?
 ASK HER. I'VE TRIED.
" OH, DON'T PUT THAT ON ME."
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TORE OUR FAMILY APART.
 AND YOU'VE DONE
A BANG-UP JOB KEEPING IT THAT WAY.
" YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT,"
HAVE YOU?
" LOOK, WE CAN STAND HERE"
"ARGUING ABOUT THE PAST ALL DAY,"
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON
THE AVATAR CAME HERE.
MY DAUGHTER IS THRILLED
TO MEET YOU.
" LIN, YOUR NIECE"
IS THE NEW AIRBENDER.
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
 YEAH. TERRIFIC.
" THOSE ARE MY TWO YOUNGEST,"
WEI AND WING.
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME CALLED
POWER DISK.
THEY INVENTED IT
ALL ON THEIR OWN.
 YAH!
" OH, NICE POWER, WEI."
 HA! WING GOES DOWN.
 I'M SO PROUD OF THOSE TWO.
"HUAN, I WANT YOU TO MEET"
THE AVATAR AND HER FRIENDS
AND YOUR AUNT LIN.
 NICE TO MEET YOU.
 HEY.
" WOW,"
THAT'S A REALLY NICE... BANANA?
"YES, VERY, VERY LIFELIKE."
IT'S NOT A BANANA!
I WAS INSPIRED
BY HARMONIC CONVERGENCE.
IT REPRESENTS THE DAWNING
"OF A NEW AGE, OBVIOUSLY."
" OH, YEAH, NO, I C..."
I CAN TOTALLY SEE THAT.
"I... WAIT, LET ME STAND HERE."
"YES, I CAN SEE THAT NOW."
YES. THANK YOU.
BANANA.
"I MEAN, THAT'S A BANANA, RIGHT?"
 AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER OPAL.
" WOW, AVATAR KORRA."
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.
YOU ARE SO AMAZING.
" IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU, OPAL."
 OPAL? THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
 THANKS.
 I'M BOLIN.
" OPAL, BUT, UH,"
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.
 GREAT. WE FOUND THE AIRBENDER.
LET'S TAKE HER BACK TO THE
AIRSHIP AND GET OUT OF HERE.
 AND THE WOMAN APPARENTLY
TRYING TO ABDUCT YOU
IS YOUR AUNT LIN.
 REALLY?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU.
MY MOM HAS TOLD ME
SO MANY STORIES ABOUT YOU.
 I'M SURE SHE HAS.
 SO I'VE SET ALL OF YOU UP
IN THE GUESTHOUSES
WHILE KORRA TRAINS OPAL.
" OH, I'M SORRY,"
BUT I WAS HOPING
SHE COULD TRAIN
WITH THE REST OF THE AIRBENDERS
AT THE NORTHERN TEMPLE.
 THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.
 NONSENSE.
THIS IS WHERE OPAL'S HOME
AND FAMILY ARE.
YOU CAN TRAIN HER HERE.
 I GUESS
I COULD HELP HER GET STARTED.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE'RE LEAVING.
 SHE'S JUST A LITTLE WORRIED
BECAUSE THERE ARE A BUNCH
OF CRAZY CRIMINALS AFTER ME.
 IF YOU'RE CONCERNED
"ABOUT SECURITY, DON'T BE."
THIS IS THE SAFEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.
"NOW, I'LL SEE YOU"
"ALL AT DINNER, AND COME HUNGRY."
MY CHEF WILL BLOW THE TASTE
BUDS RIGHT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
 WHY DO YOU HAVE
SUCH A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SISTER?
SHE SEEMS NICE.
"COME ON,"
WE CAN STAY A LITTLE WHILE.
"OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT."
 I'M NOT VERY GOOD.
 THAT'S OKAY.
I'VE NEVER BEEN
"A TEACHER BEFORE,"
SO WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT.
"YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS IN,"
"TORSO STRAIGHT,"
FEET JUST SKIMMING THE GROUND.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT WITH ME?
"WOW, YOU'RE A NATURAL."
 YOU REALLY THINK SO?
THANKS.
 YOU CALL YOURSELF
AN AIRBENDER?
DISGRACEFUL!
 BE THE LEAF!
 BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!
 NOW THAT MAN'S A LEAF.
 THE STUDENT IS
ONLY AS GOOD AS HIS MASTER.
 GREAT NEWS.
I JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM TENZIN.
HE'S WITH A WHOLE GROUP
OF OTHER AIRBENDERS
"AT THE NORTHERN TEMPLE, AND HE"
WANTS ALL OF YOU TO JOIN THEM.
WE LEAVE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.
 AND THE AVATAR IS WITH THEM?
" NO, APPARENTLY SHE HAD"
TO SPLIT OFF FROM TENZIN.
 THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HER.
" TONIGHT,"
"FOR YOUR DINING PLEASURE,"
I PRESENT A SEARED WILD KYOSHI
"ELEPHANT KOI,"
PAIRED WITH A GINGER-INFUSED
PEA TENDRIL
AND HIBISCUS ROOT SALAD.
 STUNNING.
" SORRY, DEAR, I'M GOING TO HAVE"
TO TAKE DINNER IN MY OFFICE.
I JUST HAD A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
ON THE TRAM STATION REMODEL.
" WELL, DON'T LET ME"
STAND IN THE WAY OF INSPIRATION.
 YOU'RE THE BEST.
 THAT WAS MY BRILLIANT
"ARCHITECT OF A HUSBAND, BAATAR,"
AND OUR OLDEST SON.
HE ENGINEERS
ALL MY HUSBAND'S PROJECTS.
 FIVE KIDS. WHAT A NIGHTMARE.
" NO, NO,"
MY CHILDREN ARE A BLESSING.
" YEAH,"
"MOM USED TO SAY THAT TOO,"
BUT SHE NEVER MEANT IT.
 MMM.
"I HAVE TO ADMIT,"
I WAS PRETTY SKEPTICAL
"WHEN HE SAID ""PEA TENDRIL..."""
BUT THIS IS DELICIOUS!
"I KNOW, RIGHT?"
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD
A BAD MEAL IN MY LIFE.
" OH, I HAD PLENTY"
WHEN MAKO AND I
WERE LIVING ON THE STREETS.
"I MEAN, YOU'D BE SURPRISED"
HOW BAD FOOD FROM A DUMPSTER CAN BE.
 I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW.
" NO, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY."
THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.
THINGS ARE GREAT NOW.
"I GOT TO BE A PRO BENDER,"
FOUGHT AGAINST
"A DANGEROUS REVOLUTION,"
"BECAME A MOVER STAR,"
AND NOW I'M HELPING THE AVATAR
REBUILD A WHOLE NATION.
" WOW, YOUR LIFE"
SOUNDS SO EXCITING.
 HOW'S YOUR SEARCH
FOR THE NEW AIRBENDERS GOING?
" HONESTLY, NOT GREAT."
WE HAD TO RESCUE A WHOLE GROUP
OF THEM FROM THE EARTH QUEEN.
" OH, SHE'S HORRIBLE."
SHE THINKS SHE CAN
JUST DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS.
 SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
 WHAT?
 NOTHING.
" I MEAN, THE IDEA"
OF EVEN HAVING A QUEEN
IS SO OUTDATED...
"DON'T YOU AGREE, KORRA?"
 I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.
" WELL, YOU SHOULD START."
"THE WORLD IS EVOLVING,"
AND THE EARTH QUEEN
CAN EVOLVE WITH IT
OR STEP ASIDE.
" HEY, EVERYONE,"
MY LITTLE SISTER IS AN EXPERT
ON WORLD AFFAIRS NOW.
 YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY BUGGING YOU?
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE.
" SORRY WE'RE LATE, EVERYONE."
VARRICK!
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
" GREAT QUESTION, ASAMI."
"I MEAN,"
WHAT ARE ANY OF US DOING HERE?
WOW. FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
"ANYHOO, HOW'S OUR COMPANY DOING?"
 YOU MEAN MY COMPANY?
FUTURE INDUSTRIES
REVERTED BACK TO ME
AFTER YOU PLOTTED
TO ABDUCT THE PRESIDENT.
 ALLEGEDLY PLOTTED
TO ABDUCT THE PRESIDENT.
NEVER CONVICTED.
" UH, THAT'S BECAUSE"
YOU ESCAPED PRISON.
" NO, THE UNIVERSE"
DECIDED TO SET ME FREE.
SO I LOOKED UP
"MY OLD FRIEND SUYIN HERE,"
"PITCHED HER A FEW IDEAS,"
AND BAM!
WE'RE IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.
 VARRICK'S HEADING UP
MY NEW TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.
" I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE,"
AND THE FUTURE IS MAGNETS!
I'M WORKING ON A HIGH-SPEED RAIL
THAT'LL REVOLUTIONIZE
TRANSPORTATION
AND SHIPPING AS WE KNOW IT.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! I'M...
" ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!"
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
"THE AVATAR SAFE,"
AND YOU'RE HARBORING A CRIMINAL?
" EASE UP, LIN."
"SURE, VARRICK'S MADE"
"A FEW MISTAKES IN HIS PAST,"
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE SHOULD PAY
FOR IT THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
"MY CHEF WAS A PIRATE,"
BUT NOW HE'S A CULINARY MASTER.
PEOPLE CHANGE.
 YOU HAVEN'T.
 LIN!
 SO YOU AND OPAL
SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF AT DINNER.
I THINK SHE'S REALLY INTO YOU.
" YEAH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S SWEET"
AND PRETTY AND SUPER NICE.
TOO BAD SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.
" RIGHT, I FORGOT."
YOUR TYPE IS DUMB MOVER STAR
OR PSYCHO ICE PRINCESS.
"YOU KNOW,"
THAT HURTS A LITTLE BIT.
RIGHT... HERE.
"BUT MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, BRO."
MAYBE OPAL IS BOLIN MATERIAL.
THANKS. YEAH!
" YOU KNOW,"
"BEFORE I BUILT THIS CITY,"
THERE WAS NOTHING HERE.
I WANTED TO MAKE MY MARK
ON THE WORLD.
 IT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU FOR BEING
"SO WELCOMING,"
AND I'M SORRY
FOR HOW LIN'S BEEN ACTING.
"CAN I ASK,"
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU TWO?
 IT'S COMPLICATED.
WE DIDN'T HAVE
A NORMAL CHILDHOOD.
"NEITHER OF US KNEW OUR FATHERS,"
AND TOPH WAS ALWAYS BUSY BEING
CHIEF OF POLICE.
BECAUSE MOM GREW UP
"IN SUCH A STRICT HOUSE,"
SHE GAVE US
"ALL THE FREEDOM IN THE WORLD,"
HOPING WE'D FIGURE OUT
OUR OWN PATHS.
 THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD THING.
" AND IN A WAY, IT WAS."
BUT WE BOTH ENDED UP FIGHTING
FOR MOM'S ATTENTION.
LIN FOLLOWED IN HER FOOTSTEPS
AND BECAME A COP.
I WAS MORE OF A REBEL.
MOM WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH
HOW EITHER OF US TURNED OUT.
"WHEN I WAS 16, I LEFT HOME"
TO EXPLORE THE WORLD.
I SAILED THE SEAS
"ON A PIRATE SHIP,"
JOINED A TRAVELING CIRCUS
"FOR A WHILE,"
AND LIVED IN A SANDBENDER
COMMUNE IN THE DESERT.
"IT TOOK ME A WHILE,"
BUT I FINALLY REALIZED
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
WAS A FAMILY.
"SO I BOUGHT THIS PLOT OF LAND,"
FOUND A BRILLIANT ARCHITECT
"WHO LATER BECAME MY HUSBAND,"
AND CREATED A PLACE
I COULD TRULY CALL HOME.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE CREATED THE PERFECT LIFE HERE.
 ALMOST.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED LIN
"TO BE A PART OF IT,"
BUT I GAVE UP HOPE LONG AGO
OF HER EVER COMING AROUND.
" HEY, LITTLE LADY."
"WOW, YOU'RE REALLY BLOWING ME"
AWAY WITH YOUR AIRBENDING.
 WHY ARE YOU ACTING WEIRD?
 WHY ARE YOU ACTING WEIRD?
 I DON'T LIKE
HOW YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.
" LOOK, I'M SORRY."
I JUST GET REALLY SELF-CONSCIOUS WHEN
"I KNOW A GIRL LIKES ME,"
AND I END UP ACTING STUPID.
 WHO SAID I LIKED YOU?
" OH, NO!"
BUT I THOUGHT... MAKO SAID...
 JUST KIDDING.
BUT DO ME A FAVOR
AND STOP TRYING.
"LOOK, DON'T STOP TRYING."
JUST STOP TRYING SO MUCH.
JUST BE YOURSELF.
" HUH, BE MYSELF."
"YEAH, I GUESS"
I COULD GIVE THAT A SHOT.
" OH, HEY, KORRA."
 CAN I STEAL YOU AWAY
FROM BOLIN FOR A MINUTE?
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING.
" ""LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER."
"""ENTER THE VOID."
"""EMPTY AND BECOME WIND."""
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NO ONE'S ALLOWED
IN DADDY'S STUDY EXCEPT DADDY.
 I'M SORRY. I COULDN'T SLEEP.
 WHAT WERE YOU READING?
" A POEM BY GURU LAGHIMA,"
THE WISEST AIRBENDER
WHO EVER LIVED.
" IKKI, YOU SHOULD BE IN BED."
COME ON.
 NIGHT.
 GOOD NIGHT.
 YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT
ABOUT AIRBENDER HISTORY
FOR SOMEONE
WHO JUST GOT AIRBENDING.
 I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED
THE CULTURE.
 AND YOU MOVED THROUGH
THOSE GATES LIKE A NATURAL.
WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU WERE FROM?
 A SMALL VILLAGE UP NORTH.
YOU'VE PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF IT.
 WAIT.
ZAHEER!
I NEED SOME HELP!
 HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!
 SORRY I WON'T BE JOINING YOU
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
I'M AFRAID I HAVE OTHER PLANS.
 WHO IS IT?
" HEY, IT'S ME."
I BROUGHT SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
" YOU WANT TO TALK, THEN TALK."
 I'M SORRY BEING HERE
HAS BEEN SO HARD FOR YOU.
"WHEN YOU SHOWED UP, I WAS"
SO EXCITED TO GET TO KNOW YOU.
I'D HEARD
SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU
FROM MOM AND GRANDMA TOPH.
SO I GUESS I WAS KIND OF SAD
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO GET TO KNOW ME.
"BELIEVE ME, I KNOW MY FAMILY"
CAN BE A LITTLE CRAZY
"AND OVERWHELMING SOMETIMES,"
BUT I WOULD LOVE IT SO MUCH
IF YOU WOULD BE A PART OF IT.
 GET OUT.
 SORRY.
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?
 GET OUT!
 WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
DON'T GET MAD AT OPAL.
I ASKED HER TO TALK TO YOU
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD HELP YOU
SNAP OUT OF WHATEVER FUNK
"YOU'RE IN,"
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG.
 WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS
ON FIXING THE WORLD
AND STOP TRYING
TO FIX MY FAMILY?
 SU'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE
"A BITTER, LONELY WOMAN."
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 LIN BEIFONG HAS A SISTER.
"AFTER ARRIVING IN ZAOFU,"
"KORRA MET OPAL,"
"A NEW AIRBENDER, WHOSE MOTHER"
IS LIN'S ESTRANGED HALF-SISTER.
SUYIN AND HER DAUGHTER
"WELCOMED LIN WITH OPEN ARMS,"
BUT SHE WANTED NOTHING TO DO
WITH THEM.
"MEANWHILE, ZAHEER"
INFILTRATED AIR TEMPLE ISLAND
LOOKING FOR THE AVATAR.
"AFTER BATTLING WITH KYA,"
HE ESCAPED
AND IS NOW A WANTED MAN
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
" HEY, HAS ANYONE SEEN"
CHIEF BEIFONG?
 SHE'S PROBABLY OFF SULKING
IN HER ROOM.
 I KNOW SHE HAS A PROBLEM
"WITH ME,"
BUT SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO YELL
AT OPAL LAST NIGHT.
ALL SET FOR
"YOUR POWER DISK GAME TODAY, GUYS?"
" YEAH, ALL SET"
TO KICK WEI'S BUTT.
 I'M GOING TO POWER DISK
YOUR FACE.
 YOU SHOULD COME PLAY WITH US.
" OH, I DON'T THINK"
I'D BE MUCH COMPETITION
SINCE I CAN'T METALBEND.
 REALLY?
LIN NEVER OFFERED TO TRAIN YOU?
" NOPE, AND I GUESS"
I NEVER THOUGHT TO BRING IT UP
BECAUSE I WAS LEARNING
"TO AIRBEND,"
"THEN THERE WAS THE PRO-BENDING,"
THEN I GOT TIED UP
FIGHTING THE EQUALISTS.
IT WAS A BUSY FEW MONTHS.
" WELL, IT'S PROBABLY"
FOR THE BEST.
I'M SURE LIN WOULD BE
A HORRIBLE TEACHER.
" AS THE AVATAR, YOU SHOULD HAVE"
MASTERY OVER ALL THE ELEMENTS.
I'D BE HAPPY
TO SHOW YOU THE BASICS.
 REALLY? THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
" YOU SHOULD TRY IT, TOO."
"UH, NAH,"
I'M MORE OF AN EARTH GUY.
"THE DIRT, ROCKS, YOU KNOW,"
MAYBE SOME LIGHT GRAVEL...
THAT'S KIND OF
WHERE MY HEART IS.
" OKAY, EARTH GUY."
"WELL, LET ME KNOW"
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
 AAH!
 IT WORKED!
"ZHU-LI, MARK IT DOWN."
MAGNET SUIT TEST SUCCESSFUL.
POWER DOWN.
ON TO PHASE TWO...
ZHU-LI CLEANS UP THIS MESS.
 HOW MANY PUSH-UPS
DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT?
"'CAUSE I DID, LIKE, 50."
 WHAT DO YOU TWO
THINK YOU'RE DOING?
GET BACK TO WORK.
 IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT HERE?
" THE AVATAR IS IN DANGER,"
AND THESE TWO KNUCKLEHEADS
ARE JUST STANDING AROUND
CHITCHATTING.
 DON'T WORRY.
ZAOFU IS THE
MOST SECURE CITY IN THE WORLD.
 I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.
I'M GOING TO CHECK EVERY INCH
OF THIS PLACE.
" LIN, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORK"
WHILE YOU ARE HERE.
YOU NEED TO RELAX.
 I'M FINE!
 DOESN'T TAKE A TRUTHSEER
TO KNOW
THAT YOU ARE UNDER
A DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF STRESS.
IF YOU DON'T DEAL
"WITH YOUR REPRESSED FEELINGS,"
THERE WILL BE SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES TO YOUR HEALTH
AND YOUR JOB.
 I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN TALKING ABOUT MY FEELINGS.
 YOU WON'T HAVE TO SAY A WORD.
I KNOW A GREAT ACUPUNCTURIST
IN TOWN
WHO WILL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.
 HMM.
 SEEMS LIKE YOU MADE QUITE
A STIR ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.
THE COPS ARE
SWARMING THE CITY LOOKING FOR US.
 YOU STILL WANT TO TRY
TO TAKE OUT THE PRESIDENT?
 NO. HE'LL HAVE TO WAIT.
WE LEAVE TODAY.
THERE'S OUR TICKET OUT OF HERE.
THERE'S NO MONEY.
I JUST MADE MY LAST DELIVERY.
 WE DON'T WANT MONEY.
 HOW MANY OF THOSE THINGS
ARE YOU GONNA STICK IN ME?
 I'LL BE PLACING
SEVERAL NEEDLES
ON EACH OF YOUR ACUPOINTS.
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED ABOUT.
 I'M NOT AFRAID OF NEEDLES!
 PLEASE CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
 THIS PROCESS WILL CORRECT
THE IMBALANCES
IN YOUR CHI.
PLEASE TELL ME
IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN OR PRESSURE.
 I CAN'T FEEL A THING.
 THAT'S UNUSUAL.
YOUR CHI MUST BE
POWERFULLY BLOCKED.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
MORE NEEDLES.
ACUPUNCTURE OFTEN TAPS
INTO PEOPLE'S BURIED MEMORIES.
THESE MEMORIES CAN
SOMETIMES BE DIFFICULT TO PROCESS.
" BURIED MEMORIES, UH-HUH."
"SU, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?"
WOW.
YOU ALMOST LOOK LIKE A REAL COP.
 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN SCHOOL.
" OH, NO."
ARE YOU GONNA TELL MOM?
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S GOING TO CARE.
 WHERE'D YOU GET
ALL THAT STUFF?
" UH, FELL OFF THE BACK"
OF A TRUCK.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HANGING OUT WITH THESE LOSERS?
" THEY'RE MY FRIENDS, AND YOU HAVE NO"
RIGHT TO CALL THEM THAT!
"COME ON, GUYS,"
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
" SU, STOP!"
 GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!
 YOU HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL.
YOU'RE RUINING YOUR LIFE.
 AT LEAST I HAVE A LIFE.
 THESE METEORITES ARE PERFECT
FOR BEGINNING METALBENDERS.
THE METALS HAVE
"A UNIQUE PROPERTY,"
MAKING THEM EASIER TO BEND.
 THAT'S AMAZING.
" HERE, TRY IT."
 OKAY.
"BOLIN, IS THAT YOU?"
 NO.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
" OH, HEY, LADIES."
"I WAS JUST, UH..."
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR PABU.
PABU!
 HE'S ON YOUR SHOULDER.
" OH, LOOK, THERE YOU ARE."
"YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT"
SOMETHING WAS CHEWING ON MY EAR.
I'M PROBABLY GONNA NEED
TO GET A SHOT.
PABU HAS SORT
OF A VENOM... A VENOM.
"ANYWAY, SO WHAT ARE"
YOU GUYS DOING?
YOU'RE METALBENDING OVER HERE
OR SOMETHING?
 WANT TO GIVE IT A SHOT?
" NAH, IT'S OKAY."
"I MEAN, ONLY, LIKE, ONE EARTHBENDER"
IN A HUNDRED CAN METALBEND.
" WELL, DON'T BELIEVE"
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR.
THE ONLY THING LIMITING YOU
IS YOUR ATTITUDE.
" YOU KNOW, WELL,"
MAYBE I'LL JUST...
I'LL JUST STAY AND WATCH.
 TRY TO FOCUS
ON THE FINE PIECES OF EARTH
WITHIN THE METAL.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I'M METALBENDING!
" WOW, YOU PICKED THAT UP"
"REALLY, REALLY QUICK."
I GUESS YOU'RE THAT ONE
IN A HUNDRED.
" GREAT JOB, KORRA."
 CALLING ALL UNITS.
ROBBERY REPORTED ON THE CORNER
OF FIFTH AND HARBOR.
SUSPECTS' VEHICLE HEADED SOUTH
ON HAO BOULEVARD.
"UNITS RESPONDING, IDENTIFY."
 UNIT THREE RESPONDING.
 LEAVE THEM ALONE!
 SU?
 WAIT.
LEAVING IN THE MIDDLE OF
A SESSION COULD MAKE YOU SICK.
 I'M DONE HERE.
 ARE YOU GONNA STAY
IN YOUR ROOM
FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF ALL DAY?
YOU OWE OPAL AN APOLOGY...
 FOR THE WAY
YOU TREATED HER LAST NIGHT.
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.
 I'M FINE.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?
 I TRIED TO WARN YOU.
COME WITH ME.
LET'S GO FINISH THE SESSION.
JUST RELAX AND BREATHE.
 SO YOU'RE ROBBING STORES
WITH THE TERRA TRIAD NOW?
 I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.
I JUST DROVE THE CAR.
I OWED MY FRIENDS A FAVOR.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
 I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS.
OH.
"WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,"
"OFFICER, ARREST ME?"
 DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT TAKING ONE MORE STEP!
 GOOD AFTERNOON.
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO TODAY?
" I, UH, GOT"
A DELIVERY TO MAKE IN BAO YU.
I SHOULD BE BACK LATER TODAY.
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
" YEAH, JUST A LITTLE TIRED."
"ONE MORE PICKUP,"
THEN I'M CLOCKING OUT.
 I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD A DELIVERY.
 DID I?
 I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE
AND OPEN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.
" HEY, GET BACK HERE!"
 LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
"HMM, HMM."
" HEY, BOLIN."
"OPAL! OH, WOW."
YOU REALLY
KNOW HOW TO SNEAK UP ON SOMEONE.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
" OH, NOTHING, YOU KNOW, JUST..."
JUST THINKING ABOUT MY BODY AND
MUSTACHES THAT I MIGHT HAVE
IN THE FUTURE.
 YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD AGAIN.
 SORRY.
I WASN'T REALLY THINKING
ABOUT ALL MY MUSTACHES.
I'M JUST... I'M JUST FRUSTRATED.
"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO METALBEND,"
AND I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
"DON'T TELL ANYONE, OKAY?"
 WHY NOT?
 BECAUSE IT'S EMBARRASSING.
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
I'VE TRIED.
"I MEAN, I'VE BEEN WANTING"
TO METALBEND
EVER SINCE I HEARD ABOUT TOPH.
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
IS MY BIGGEST HERO.
 MY MOM GREW UP
LEARNING FROM TOPH.
JUST GO TRAIN WITH HER.
STOP BEING SO SCARED.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
"MAYBE I AM SCARED,"
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
"TO TRAIN WITH TENZIN,"
BUT YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT
"BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID, TOO."
 YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MY FAMILY
AND DISAPPOINT MY MOM.
 LOOK AT US...
"TALKING ABOUT OUR FEELINGS,"
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER.
 IT'S NICE.
 WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
YOU TWO HAVE PUT ME
IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.
 YOU'RE MAD AT ME?
SHE'S THE ONE WHO WAS
RUNNING AROUND WITH CRIMINALS.
 THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
 I WAS DOING MY JOB!
" UGH, ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!"
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
"SU, YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE CITY"
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
 WHAT?
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?
 YOU'LL GO STAY
WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS.
"LIN, GIVE ME THE ARREST REPORT."
" MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
YOU CAN'T COVER THIS UP.
THERE WERE WITNESSES.
 I'M THE CHIEF OF POLICE.
I CAN'T HAVE A DAUGHTER IN JAIL.
" SO, ONCE AGAIN,"
"SU GETS TO DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS,"
AND THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES.
THIS IS OUR ONLY OPTION.
 YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL
"A BIT FRAGILE,"
SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST
IF YOU TAKE IT EASY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
 I DON'T NEED TO REST.
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
I SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE THE FIRST
METALBENDING AVATAR.
" SO, UM, I'VE BEEN THINKING,"
AND I'D LIKE TO TRY
TO LEARN METALBENDING.
"I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU HAVE"
"A WAITING LIST OR SOMETHING,"
"LIKE, A COUPLE YEARS, SO..."
 LET'S GET STARTED.
 I THINK LIN IS MAD
ABOUT SOMETHING.
" SU, IT'S TIME WE TALK."
" AFTER 30 YEARS,"
YOU'RE FINALLY READY TO TALK?
 WHEN WE WERE IN MOM'S OFFICE
"THAT DAY,"
YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN
"RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DID,"
BUT INSTEAD YOU STAYED QUIET
AND LET MOM
THROW HER WHOLE CAREER AWAY.
 MOM DIDN'T THROW
HER CAREER AWAY.
SHE RETIRED THE NEXT YEAR.
SHE WAS A HERO.
 YOU THINK
SHE WANTED TO RETIRE?
SHE WAS SO GUILT-RIDDEN ABOUT
"WHAT SHE DID TO PROTECT YOU,"
SHE DIDN'T FEEL WORTHY
OF HER BADGE.
" LOOK, I ADMIT"
THAT I WAS NOT A PERFECT KID
AND I'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES
"IN THE PAST, BUT..."
YOU MADE SOME MISTAKES?
" LIN, MOM AND I"
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS YEARS AGO
AND WORKED THINGS OUT.
IF YOU HAD GOTTEN TOGETHER
"WITH US LIKE WE'D ASKED,"
YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.
I'VE BEEN A DIFFERENT PERSON
FOR A LONG TIME.
 YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE
"YOU LIVE IN A BIG, FANCY HOUSE"
AND HAVE A CHEF
WHO COOKS YOU FANCY FOOD
THAT YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON?
MAYBE YOU CAN FOOL EVERYONE
"ELSE, BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME."
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU.
" YOU KNOW WHAT, LIN?"
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HASN'T CHANGED.
YOU'RE STILL A BITTER LONER
WHO ONLY CARES ABOUT HERSELF.
NO WONDER TENZIN ENDED THINGS
WITH YOU YEARS AGO.
" OKAY, I GUESS"
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.
 SHOULD I STOP THEM?
 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SIBLINGS.
FIGHTING IS ALL PART
OF THE HEALING PROCESS.
" GO, MOM!"
MY SCULPTURE!
"ACTUALLY, IT LOOKS"
KIND OF BETTER NOW.
 YOU GOT IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?
 NOT QUITE YET!
 WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?
YOU'RE SISTERS!
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO HURT EACH OTHER?
" UH, WHO'S GONNA KNOCK?"
" OH! NO, NO, NO,"
"NO, NO, NO. NOT ME."
YOU'RE THE AVATAR.
WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT?
" UH, I CAN."
BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT YOU...
 I'LL DO IT.
"UH, CHIEF,"
YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING FOR 16 HOURS.
WE JUST WANTED TO
MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE OKAY.
OOH!
GOOD MORNING.
WHAT'S THIS?
 I CALL IT THE KALENUTSCO.
"IT'S A MIXTURE OF KALE,"
"COCONUT WATER, AND WALNUTS."
 NOT BAD.
"OPAL, DON'T GO."
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
"LOOK, I'M JUST NOT"
REALLY COMFORTABLE
TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS
"OF THINGS,"
"AND, WELL..."
I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.
 IT'S OKAY.
 YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP AND...
 IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO BE HERE.
 YOU'RE A SMART YOUNG WOMAN
AND AN EXCELLENT AIRBENDER.
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO TRAIN
WITH THE OTHER AIRBENDERS
AT THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
 THERE'S A PART OF ME
"THAT WANTS TO GO,"
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET MY MOM.
" WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,"
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS PLEASE MY MOTHER.
I BECAME A POLICE CHIEF
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
"IT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY,"
BUT IT DIDN'T.
YOU NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS
BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT.
DON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES I DID.
 MOM? DAD?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
 OPAL HAS DECIDED TO GO
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
I'M GUESSING YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HER DECISION.
" WELL, I WAS JUST..."
 IT'S OKAY.
I'M GLAD SHE WAS HONEST WITH ME.
I WANT HER TO DO
WHAT MAKES HER HAPPY.
"MOM GAVE US TOO MUCH FREEDOM,"
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE
OF GIVING OPAL TOO LITTLE.
I THINK IT'S TIME
I LET HER CHOOSE HER OWN WAY.
I'M SORRY I GAVE YOU
SUCH A HARD TIME
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT MY LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE
"IF MOM HADN'T SENT ME AWAY,"
IF I HAD STAYED IN THE CITY.
 YOU'D PROBABLY BE IN PRISON.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
MAKO TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT POLICE CHIEF.
REPUBLIC CITY IS LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.
I KNOW MOM IS PROUD.
CAN WE MOVE ON?
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO BE
A PART OF MY LIFE AGAIN.
THERE'S PLENTY
"OF SPACE FOR YOU IN THE HOUSE,"
AND THE KIDS WOULD LOVE
HAVING THEIR AUNT AROUND.
I DO NEED A CO-DIRECTOR
FOR MY NEW DANCE PERFORMANCE.
 WHOA. SLOW DOWN.
"HOW ABOUT FOR NOW,"
I JUST PROMISE
NOT TO SHOW UP AT YOUR HOUSE
AND ATTACK YOU AGAIN?
 DEAL.
 WE SHOULD'VE GRABBED
ONE OF THOSE COPS.
MAYBE THEY KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT WHERE THE AVATAR
IS HIDING.
 SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.
 WE'LL FIND HER.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
 SHE'S WITH THE METAL CLAN.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
THE AIR NATION IS REBORN!
THANKS TO THE ENERGY SHIFT
"DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,"
CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE ACQUIRED
"AIRBENDING ABILITIES,"
"INCLUDING BUMI, KAI, AND OPAL."
BUT ALTHOUGH THE NEW RECRUITS
"SHOW A LOT OF PROMISE,"
THEY STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.
SO WHILE KORRA REMAINS SAFE
"IN ZAOFU,"
TENZIN HAS BROUGHT
THE AIRBENDERS
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE
TO BEGIN THEIR TRAINING.
 HIS PUPILS ONCE AGAIN PLEADED
WITH THEIR MASTER
"TO EAT SOMETHING,"
"BUT HE REFUSED,"
JUST LIKE HE HAD EACH DAY
THE ENTIRE SUMMER.
"INSTEAD, HE SIMPLY MEDITATED,"
GETTING HIS NOURISHMENT
FROM THE UNIVERSE.
SO MONK TANG XU COMPLETED
THE 97TH DAY
OF HIS HISTORIC FAST
ON WHICH ISLAND?
"OOH! OOH, OOH!"
"ANYONE BESIDES OTAKU,"
WHO ALREADY STUDIED THIS
IN HIS ACOLYTE TRAINING...
"OOH, OOH, OOH!"
AND IS ANSWERING EVERY QUESTION?
OOH! OOH! OOH!
WHALETAIL ISLAND!
THAT IS CORRECT. AGAIN.
"NOW, ON DAY 98..."
"GREETINGS, AIR PEOPLE."
I COME SEEKING BORING STORIES
TO TAKE
BACK TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.
 THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!
WHEN DO WE GET TO FLY AROUND
ON OUR OWN BISON LIKE THAT?
ONLY AFTER MANY YEARS
OF PRACTICE
AND INTENSE TRAINING.
"BESIDES, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH"
BISON HERE FOR ALL OF YOU.
WHAT ABOUT THOSE?
IT'S A WHOLE HERD OF BISONS.
"ACTUALLY, THE PLURAL"
"OF ""BISON"" IS ""BISON."""
WHOA!
 COOL!
" WOW, LOOK AT THAT."
CAN WE RIDE THOSE?
"NO, THAT'S A WILD HERD."
IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS
TO TAME THEM.
NOW LET'S GET BACK
TO OUR LESSONS.
DAD!
WE BROUGHT YOU MORE AIRBENDERS!
"OKAY, EVERYONE IS DISMISSED."
WE'LL JUST PICK THIS UP...
TOMORROW.
HOW WAS EVERYTHING IN THE CITY?
"WELL, WE HAD A LITTLE SCARE,"
BUT EVERYTHING IS OKAY.
ZAHEER INFILTRATED
THE AIR TEMPLE.
WHAT? IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?
EVERYONE'S FINE.
"I FOUGHT WITH HIM,"
BUT HE GOT AWAY.
AND HE STOLE SOME OLD NECKLACE
THAT HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH GURU LAK... SCHMEER.
GURU LAGHIMA.
RIGHT.
"YOU KNOW, I CAN NEVER KEEP"
ALL THOSE GURUS STRAIGHT.
"THERE WERE, LIKE,"
A MILLION OF THEM.
"REMEMBER THAT LONG,"
BORING STORY ABOUT THE GUY
WHO NEVER ATE?
"YES, I REMEMBER."
AVATAR KORRA IS CALLING
ON THE TEMPLE RADIO.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHERE ARE YOU?
WITH BEIFONG'S SISTER IN ZAOFU.
"WE'RE TOTALLY SAFE,"
UNLESS WE GET CAUGHT
IN ANOTHER FIGHT
BETWEEN SU AND LIN.
LIN WILLINGLY TOOK YOU
TO HER SISTER?
NOT EXACTLY.
WE GOT A CALL
"ABOUT A NEW AIRBENDER,"
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE
"SU'S DAUGHTER, OPAL."
SHE'LL BE HEADED YOUR WAY SOON.
REALLY? THAT'S WONDERFUL!
SHE IS WONDERFUL
AND PRETTY AND SO SMART!
AND SHE SMELLS LIKE FLOWERS.
SORRY.
BOLIN OUT.
HOW'S THE TRAINING GOING?
"NOT SO WELL, I'M AFRAID."
NO ONE SEEMS TO BE INTERESTED
IN THE HARD WORK
REQUIRED TO BECOME A PART
OF THE AIR NATION.
YOU NEED TO GIVE
YOURSELF A BREAK.
LET JINORA AND THE KIDS
HELP YOU OUT.
AND WHAT ABOUT BUMI?
HE WAS A NAVAL COMMANDER.
MAYBE HE HAS SOME IDEAS
ABOUT HOW TO GET
PEOPLE MOTIVATED.
BUMI? HE'S MY WORST STUDENT!
"YEAH, BUT HE LOVES"
TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE.
"IF YOU ASK HIM FOR HELP,"
YOU CAN TRICK HIM
INTO TAKING MORE RESPONSIBILITY
BY MAKING HIM THINK
THE WHOLE THING WAS HIS IDEA.
HMM.
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
YOU'RE TURNING INTO
A PRETTY WISE AVATAR AFTER ALL.
CONFLICT RESOLUTION.
IT'S WHAT I DO.
WE SHOULD GO DOWN THERE.
I WANT TO FLY
ONE OF THOSE BISONS.
I DON'T KNOW.
WE MIGHT GET IN TROUBLE.
"COME ON, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN."
WE'LL BE BACK BEFORE ANYONE
REALIZES WE'RE GONE.
I GUESS IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.
" LOOK, BABY BISONS."
HOW COME THEY'RE ALL
ON THE GROUND?
AIR BISON CALVES CAN'T FLY
FOR A WEEK OR TWO
"AFTER THEY'RE BORN,"
SO THE ENTIRE HERD WILL STAY
NEAR THE GROUND IN THE VALLEY.
LET'S GO SEE THE BABIES.
BE CAREFUL.
THE MOTHERS ARE VERY PROTECTIVE.
"AW, LOOK HOW CUTE."
"KAI, GET OUT OF THERE!"
WHOA!
"WOW, YOU REALLY SAVED ME"
DOWN THERE.
 OH.
" YOU KNOW,"
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE AIRBENDER.
"WELL, I'VE BEEN TRAINING"
FOR A LONG TIME.
THEN WHY DON'T YOU HAVE TATTOOS
LIKE AN AIRBENDING MASTER?
MY DAD SAYS
I'M NOT A MASTER YET.
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING
"YOUR DAD CAN,"
PLUS YOU HAVE
ALL THOSE SPIRIT-Y POWERS.
"IF ANYONE'S A MASTER, YOU ARE."
SO WE BRING THE NET DOWN
"ON THE HEAD PIRATE,"
AND HE LOOKS AROUND REAL SAD
"AND SAYS, ""I KNEW I SHOULD"
HAVE FOLLOWED MY DREAMS
"""AND BECOME A DENTIST."""
HOW COME YOU GREW UP
"TO BE SO COOL,"
WHILE TENZIN BECAME
SUCH A STICK IN THE MUD?
"WELL, I GUESS ""COOL"""
IS JUST SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH.
"BUMI, CAN I TALK TO YOU?"
LET ME GUESS... YOU WANT
TO CRITICIZE ME FOR SOMETHING.
"ACTUALLY, I NEED YOUR HELP."
"OH, YEAH? WITH WHAT?"
I DON'T THINK
I'M DOING VERY WELL
"WITH THE NEW AIRBENDERS,"
AND EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE A NATURAL LEADER.
"TRUE, I DID WIN THE ADMIRAL TUNG"
NATURAL LEADERSHIP AWARD TWICE.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE?
HELP ME BE MORE LIKE YOU.
I'D LOVE TO.
YOU'VE GOTTA USE
MILITARY DISCIPLINE
TO WHIP THESE TROOPS INTO SHAPE.
THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL
WITH NEW RECRUITS
"IS TO BREAK THEM DOWN,"
SO YOU CAN BUILD THEM BACK UP.
RULE WITH AN IRON FIST.
SHOW THEM WHO THE MASTER IS.
THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT.
MY PLEASURE.
DAWN PATROL! EVERYONE UP!
UGH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S BARELY LIGHT OUT.
I'M TAKING YOUR ADVICE.
I'M GOING TO BREAK YOU DOWN
AND BUILD YOU BACK UP.
"NOW GET MOVING, RECRUIT!"
NOTHING LIKE A 10-MILE HIKE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
DON'T THESE ROBES COME
"IN A WARM, BISON FUR VERSION?"
"NO, OF COURSE NOT!"
OH!
"IF IT WEREN'T SO COLD,"
I'D GO RIGHT BACK TO SLEEP.
THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME
TO LEARN MEDITATION
AND PROPER BREATHING TECHNIQUE.
AIRBENDERS ARE ABLE
TO WARM THEMSELVES
WITH ONLY THEIR BREATHING.
EVERYONE GET
INTO THE LOTUS POSITION.
"AH, THIS IS SO MUCH MORE"
REFRESHING THAN SLEEPING.
"YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAID"
THAT THING ABOUT AN IRON FIST...
HUSH. MEDITATION TIME.
FOCUS.
CAN WE GO BACK TO BED NOW?
NOW THAT WE'RE REFRESHED
AND LOOSE
"FROM OUR HIKE AND MEDITATION,"
IT'S TIME
FOR A BALANCING EXERCISE.
THE KEY IS TO MAINTAIN YOUR
HEAVEN AND EARTH CONNECTION.
NOW YOU TRY.
 BACK ON THE POSTS!
IT'S NOT HARD
IF YOU CONCENTRATE!
 WHOA.
 UGH.
WHOA! UGH!
GET BACK UP!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
"YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT, SOLDIER?"
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON THEM?
DON'T WORRY. THEY CAN TAKE IT.
YOU'LL SEE.
IGNORE THE LEMURS
DIGGING IN YOUR EARS.
"CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BREATHING,"
AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
THEY'RE THERE.
"WHOA, UH, UGH, OH!"
"WHEN THE HEAD IS SHAVED,"
AN AIRBENDER IS ABLE
TO FEEL THE WIND AROUND HIM.
IT IS BOTH HUMBLING AND FREEING.
"HEY, YOU WANNA SNEAK AWAY"
AND GO CHECK ON THE BABY BISONS?
SHH. YOU SHOULD BE
PAYING ATTENTION.
"ALL RIGHT, WHO'S NEXT?"
I'M NOT SURE I WANT
TO SHAVE MY HEAD.
THAT'S FINE.
SHAVING YOUR HEAD
IS A PERSONAL CHOICE.
"WAIT, WHAT?"
ANYONE ELSE?
"FINE, THEN WE CAN GET RIGHT"
TO OUR NEXT TRAINING EXERCISE...
OBSTACLE COURSE!
YOU'RE PUSHING TOO HARD.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM
A BREAK.
"JINORA, I HAVE THIS"
UNDER CONTROL.
CONCENTRATE.
"REMEMBER, AIRBENDERS MOVE"
LIKE THE WIND.
AGH!
UGH!
" STAY LIGHT ON YOUR FEET,"
AND YOU'LL NEVER FEEL
THE STINGING RASH-CACTUS.
 OW!
EVERYONE IS WAITING
"FOR YOU, BUMI."
IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT OVER
"IN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS,"
THEY'LL ALL HAVE TO RUN
THROUGH THE COURSE AGAIN.
" YOU CAN DO IT, BUMI!"
 COME ON!
AGH!
"GET BACK ON THAT WALL, RECRUIT!"
YOU'RE LETTING
YOUR FELLOW AIRBENDERS DOWN.
I'M FINISHED!
I NEVER WANTED
"TO BE AN AIRBENDER,"
AND I'M TOO OLD TO BE
BACK IN BOOT CAMP!
COUNT ME OUT.
"FINE, QUIT!"
WE DON'T NEED YOUR ATTITUDE
IN THE NEW AIR NATION.
MASTER TENZIN?
WHEN DO WE GET TO GO HOME
AND VISIT OUR FAMILIES?
GO HOME? YOU JUST GOT HERE.
WHEN'S DINNER? I'M STARVING.
CAN I CHANGE OUT OF MY ROBE NOW?
IT'S ITCHY.
THIS IS JUST AS BAD
AS THE EARTH QUEEN'S PRISON.
I'M TIRED
OF ALL THIS COMPLAINING.
"JINORA, TAKE OVER."
DOES THIS MEAN
I'M THE MASTER NOW?
YES. JUST LEAD THEM
THROUGH SOME BASIC EXERCISES.
"WELL, SINCE I'M A MASTER,"
WHEN DO YOU THINK I CAN GET
MY TATTOOS?
 WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?
" I WAS JUST TALKING TO KAI,"
"AND HE WAS ASKING ME, SO..."
KAI! WHAT DOES HE KNOW
ABOUT WHEN
YOU SHOULD GET TATTOOS?
THE ANSWER IS NO!
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE GIRL.
I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE!
I CAN AIRBEND
JUST AS WELL AS YOU.
I KNOW EVERYTHING
"ABOUT OUR CULTURE AND HISTORY,"
AND I HAVE A STRONGER
CONNECTION WITH THE SPIRITS
THAN YOU EVER WILL.
LEAD YOUR OWN CLASS!
"IKKI, MEELO, YOU'RE UP."
JUST LEAD THEM
THROUGH THE BAGUA CIRCLE.
LOOK TO YOUR LEFT!
LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT!
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL NOT
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE.
SORRY IF WHAT I SAID
GOT YOU IN TROUBLE
WITH YOUR DAD.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
HE JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I'M GROWN UP NOW
AND I DON'T NEED HIM
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO
LIKE ONE OF HIS RECRUITS.
I KNOW SOMETHING
THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.
WHERE DID ALL THE SPIRITS GO?
WHERE ARE THE BABIES?
 AAH!
WHAT ARE THESE KIDS DOING
IN MY CAMP?
WE CAUGHT THEM SNEAKING AROUND.
WE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT
TELL SOMEONE WE'RE HERE.
THEY'RE THOSE NEW AIRBENDERS.
MUST BE LIVING UP AT THE TEMPLE.
HURRY UP AND GATHER
"THE REST OF THE GANG,"
AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE SOMEONE COMES LOOKING
FOR THESE KIDS.
WE'LL TAKE THEM TO BA SING SE
WITH THE REST OF THE FRESH MEAT.
TATTOOS. HOW CAN SHE THINK...
FOCUS.
BREATHE.
BUMI RUINS EVERYTHING.
INHALE.
FOCUS.
TAKING A LITTLE BREAK
FROM TEACHING?
I FAILED.
"BUMI QUIT, AND THE REST"
OF THE AIRBENDERS
WANT TO GO HOME.
CAN'T THEY SEE THAT I'M TRYING
TO REBUILD AN ENTIRE CULTURE?
"YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE"
"THESE PEOPLE CAN AIRBEND,"
IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY
MAKE THEM AIR NOMADS.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
I REMEMBER WHEN I MOVED
OUT OF MY PARENTS' HOUSE
TO BECOME AN AIR ACOLYTE.
"THAT FIRST NIGHT,"
"I WAS SO SCARED AND LONELY,"
AND THE BED WAS SO HARD.
IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER
FOR YOUR BACK.
SORRY.
"THE POINT IS,"
"I REALLY WANTED TO BE THERE,"
BUT IT STILL TOOK TIME
FOR ME TO ADJUST
AND FEEL LIKE I WAS
A PART OF IT ALL.
THESE PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY
FEELING THE SAME WAY.
YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT.
NOW I KNOW HOW KORRA FEELS
WHEN I'M TALKING TO HER.
"THANK YOU, PEMA."
"BUMI, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE"
FOR LOSING MY PATIENCE.
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.
"HEY, GET BACK HERE!"
WHERE'S JINORA?
I SAW HER FLY OFF
ON HER GLIDER WITH HER BOYFRIEND.
WHAT? HER BOYFRIEND?
KAI.
HOW CAN YOU STEAL THESE BISON?
THEY'RE ENDANGERED.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WORTH
SO MUCH.
THE EARTH QUEEN
AND HER FANCY FRIENDS
PAY BIG MONEY FOR BISON STEAKS
AND OTHER WEIRD MEAT.
I EVEN HEARD SHE ATE
HER DAD'S PET BEAR.
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.
"HEY, DO THAT SPIRIT BEAMING"
THING YOU DID TO FIND ME.
GO TO THE TEMPLE FOR HELP.
I CAN'T.
"I'M ALL CRAMPED IN HERE,"
AND I NEED QUIET
AND TIME TO FOCUS.
BUT MAYBE I CAN SEND A MESSAGE.
"SPIRITS, I NEED YOUR HELP."
GO FIND BUM-JU.
TELL HIM WE'RE IN TROUBLE.
" NO, I DON'T THINK"
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE.
TENZIN JUST WANTS
TO BOSS EVERYBODY AROUND.
I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.
"WELL, LET'S FACE IT."
I'M JUST NOT CUT OUT TO BE
AN AIRBENDER.
"WELL, THAT'S YOUR OPINION."
"WAIT, DID JINORA SEND"
THIS SPIRIT?
IS SHE IN TROUBLE?
JINORA'S IN TROUBLE!
 WE HAVE TO GO GET HER.
 HOW DO YOU KNOW?
BUM-JU'S FRIEND TOLD ME.
YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE SPIRITS?
MORE OR LESS. I GET THE GIST.
LET'S GO!
SHOULDN'T MASTER TENZIN
BE DEALING WITH THIS?
I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO TROUBLE.
MASTER TENZIN ISN'T HERE.
IT'S UP TO US.
"IKKI AND MEELO, GRAB SOME BISON."
"AIRBENDERS, MOVE OUT!"
BISON RUSTLERS.
THEY'VE GOT KAI AND JINORA
LOCKED IN CRATES.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GETTING
READY TO LEAVE.
WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE FAST.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M READY
TO GET IN A FIGHT
WITH SOME BISON RUSTLERS.
I CAN TELL WITHOUT THE TELESCOPE
THAT THEY'RE MEAN-LOOKING.
"LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT"
WE'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR.
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINING
THAT LONG.
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT NOW.
REMEMBER HOW WE PERSEVERED
TOGETHER ON THE OBSTACLE COURSE?
YOU ACTUALLY QUIT.
"WELL, I'M NOT QUITTING NOW."
I KNOW WE'VE HAD
A TOUGH TIME... ME MORE THAN ANYONE...
"BUT WE'RE AIRBENDERS,"
"AND THERE AREN'T MANY OF US,"
SO WE'VE GOT TO STICK TOGETHER.
THEY'VE GOT TWO OF OUR OWN
"IN CAGES OUT THERE,"
AND WE'RE NOT LEAVING
UNTIL WE BRING THEM HOME.
"IN, DOWN, AND... TWIST"
FREE THE BISON FIRST.
"HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT?"
OOF! UGH!
OOH!
KAI!
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?
"KAI, HELP!"
"I'M COMING, JINORA."
WHAT THE...
YOU GOT ME.
I GIVE UP.
YOU THINK YOU CAN KIDNAP JINORA
AND ALL THESE BABY BISONS?
 KAI! THAT'S ENOUGH.
AN AIRBENDER NEVER ATTACKS
A DEFENSELESS OPPONENT.
BUT THAT WAS
VERY GOOD TECHNIQUE.
"MAYBE YOU BOYS HAVEN'T HEARD,"
BUT THERE'S SOME
NEW AIRBENDERS AROUND THESE PARTS.
AND YOU NEVER MESS
WITH AN AIRBENDER'S BISON.
"WITHOUT MY SHAVED HEAD,"
I NEVER COULD HAVE DODGED
THAT NET.
I REALLY FELT IT COMING AT ME.
YOU GUYS SHOULD TOTALLY
GET SHAVED.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
YOUR CONNECTION WITH THE
SPIRITS AND NATURAL LEADERSHIP...
YOU REMIND ME OF DAD.
I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN
CAUSING YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE.
I GUESS I WAS JUST SCARED
OF NOT BEING ABLE
TO MEASURE UP AS AN AIRBENDER.
"YOU KNOW,"
"EVEN THOUGH I'M AANG'S SON,"
I NEVER REALLY FELT LIKE I WAS
PART OF THE AIR NATION BEFORE.
YOU ARE NOW.
THEY'RE SO FRIENDLY NOW.
THE BISON ARE
THE ORIGINAL AIRBENDERS.
THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN KIND.
I'M SORRY FOR RUNNING OFF.
WE'RE JUST LUCKY
NO ONE WAS HURT.
 I KNOW.
 BUT I ALSO REALIZE
THAT PERHAPS I WAS
TOO HARSH WITH YOU.
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN GET
MY AIRBENDER TATTOOS?
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE
THAT MY LITTLE GIRL
HAS GROWN UP ENOUGH
TO HAVE HER TATTOOS.
BUT I PROMISE
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
 FAIR ENOUGH?
 YEAH.
"JINORA, LOOK! THEY'RE FLYING!"
I GUESS EVERYONE IS GROWING UP.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR
CAN MASTER ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 KORRA IS NOW THE
FIRST METAL-BENDING AVATAR.
"AFTER TRAINING WITH SU BEIFONG,"
KORRA QUICKLY PICKED UP
THE NEW SKILL.
AND BOLIN IS HOPING
TO FOLLOW IN HER FOOTSTEPS.
"MEANWHILE, THE AIRBENDER ZAHEER"
IS CLOSING IN ON ZAOFU.
"BY HIS SIDE,"
ARE THE LAVABENDER GHAZAN
"THE WATERBENDER MING-HUA,"
AND THE COMBUSTIONBENDER P'LI.
BUT WHAT DO THESE
MYSTERIOUS CRIMINALS
WANT WITH THE AVATAR?
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SPARRING
WITH THE AVATAR.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STUCK
WITH HER FRIEND.
"HANG ON, I THINK I GOT IT."
LET ME JUST TRY THIS.
"NO? OKAY, MAYBE IF I... OW!"
TRIAL BY FIRE!
IT'S THE BEST WAY
TO LEARN METAL-BENDING.
" OH, NICE SHOT, BOLIN."
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICING
"METAL-BENDING, NOT EARTH-BENDING."
"YEAH, CHEATER."
"MAKO, METAL-BENDING"
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.
"NO ONE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY,"
IF THEY CAN GET IT AT ALL!
IT'S NOT NORMAL!
WHOO-HOO! METAL-BENDING CHAMPION.
"OH, SURE. SHE'S THE AVATAR."
"GUYS, IT'S TIME TO GET CLEANED UP."
TONIGHT'S OPAL'S FAREWELL DINNER.
NOW I GOTTA SAY BYE TO OPAL?
THIS IS THE WORST DAY EVER!
THANKS FOR MAKING MY FAVORITE MEAL.
"I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU, OPAL."
NO ONE APPRECIATES
MY RAW VEGGIE WRAPS LIKE YOU DO.
"EVERY TIME I EAT RAW KALE,"
I'M GONNA THINK OF YOU.
YOU'RE SO SWEET.
THIS STINKS.
WE WERE JUST STARTING
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
AND NOW YOU'RE OFF
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
WE'LL BE TOGETHER SOON.
YOU GUYS ARE HEADING UP
"AFTER FINDING MORE AIRBENDERS, RIGHT?"
"YEAH, BUT THAT'S... IN THE FUTURE."
"OH, I HATE THE FUTURE."
"UNTIL THEN, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE KALE."
"KID, CAN I GIVE YOU"
SOME RELATIONSHIP ADVICE?
"UM, NO."
"WELL, YOUR LOSS."
"ZHU-LI! BRING THE, UH, THING."
CHECK OUT MY LATEST INVENTION.
AN AIRBENDER FINDER.
"WAIT, THAT CAN FIND AIRBENDERS?"
"UH, I THINK IT'S BROKEN."
IT'S NOT BROKEN.
SHE NEEDS TO AIR-BEND INTO IT!
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPECT
THE THING TO WORK?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.
I HATE SITTING DOWN HERE.
NOT BECAUSE OF YOU.
 I CAN TELL YOU'RE LYING.
"EVERYONE, IF I COULD HAVE"
"YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE."
"TONIGHT, MY BEAUTIFUL"
LITTLE GIRL LEAVES
FOR THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
"OPAL, NONE OF US COULD BE"
MORE PROUD OF YOU.
"YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE DAUGHTER,"
"SISTER, FRIEND,"
AND SOON-TO-BE AIRBENDING MASTER.
HERE'S TO OPAL.
MAY SHE HELP LEAD US
INTO THE NEW ERA.
LOCK IT DOWN FOR THE NIGHT.
WE'LL HEAD OUT FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.
"KALE, KALE, KALE."
WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?
"PABU, SLEEP."
WHAT? HUH? WHAT?
PABU.
IT'S NOT PLAYTIME RIGHT NOW.
"OKAY, WE ARE SERIOUSLY"
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A TALK...
WHAT THE HECK!
THEY GOT KORRA!
THEY'VE GOT KORRA!
LET HER GO!
THEY'VE GOT KORRA!
SO MUCH FOR THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
BACK-UP PLAN.
WE CAN'T LET THEM TAKE HER.
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO GET FAR. LOOK.
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.
IT'S OVER.
RELEASE THE AVATAR!
NO WAY!
THAT GUY'S LAVA-BENDING.
THAT'S AWESOME...
LY NOT GOOD FOR US.
I'M GOING TO CREATE SOME COVER.
WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
HOW DID THEY GET IN HERE?
"I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'RE NOT"
LETTING THEM ESCAPE.
WHOA!
THERE'S NO WAY TO CROSS THAT MOAT.
WE DON'T NEED TO CROSS IT.
LIN AND I CAN DROP IN
FROM THE DOME ON CABLES.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
"EXCEPT, WE'LL GET BLOWN UP"
THE SECOND
THAT THIRD-EYED FREAK SEES US.
SHE'S A COMBUSTIONBENDER.
"IF ONE OF YOU CAN STUN HER,"
HER POWERS WILL BE
KNOCKED OUT TEMPORARILY.
 BOLIN CAN LAND A SHOT.
 I CAN?
YOU HAVE TO TAKE HER OUT
RIGHT BEFORE WE DROP DOWN.
I DO?
OPEN THE HATCH.
"IF WE GET IN TROUBLE, METAL-BEND US UP."
WE'RE IN POSITION.
COPY THAT. IT'S BOLIN TIME.
ALL RIGHT. BOLIN TIME. BOLIN TIME!
I CAN'T GET A CLEAN SHOT!
YOU HAVE TO!
 ARE WE A GO?
 NO GO.
 COPY THAT. WE'RE A GO.
 I SAID NO! WAIT!
"BOLIN, TAKE THE SHOT!"
"NICE JOB, LITTLE BRO."
NO!
THANKS.
WE FAILED!
WHERE DID THEY GO?
THEY CAN'T BE FAR.
"GUARDS, SEARCH THE ENTIRE ESTATE."
THIS SHOULD NEUTRALIZE
THE SHIRASHU TOXINS.
HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?
YOU ASSURED ME THIS WAS
ONE OF THE MOST
SECURE PLACES IN THE WORLD.
IT IS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED.
OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS
"A WELL-PLANNED OPERATION,"
SO DON'T BLAME ME.
WE SEARCHED THE ENTIRE ESTATE.
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM.
"WELL, KEEP LOOKING!"
IT WOULD SEEM THEY HAD
SOME INSIDE KNOWLEDGE OF ZAOFU.
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
WORKING WITH SOMEONE.
THE... THE GUARDS.
IT HAD TO BE ONE OF THEM.
 I AGREE.
 QUESTION THEM ALL!
WHOEVER BETRAYED MY CITY
WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!
WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME?
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE
OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED
TO KIDNAP THE AVATAR?
MY NAME IS XU GUAN.
I WAS PATROLLING THE SOUTH
WALL OF THE BEIFONG ESTATES.
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE
OF THE PEOPLE
THAT TRIED TO KIDNAP KORRA.
WHAT WAS I DOING LAST NIGHT?
SAME THING I ALWAYS DO.
"FROM 9:00 TO 10:00,"
I CHECKED MY BODY FOR TICKS.
LYME DISEASE IS A SERIOUS KILLER.
THEN I DID MY NIGHTLY
VARRI-CALISTHENICS
FOLLOWED BY 30 MINUTES
OF BREATH HOLDING.
I FILMED THE WHOLE THING
IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT.
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
MAYBE IT WASN'T A GUARD AFTER ALL.
MAYBE IT WAS SOMEONE A LITTLE
HIGHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN.
"AIWEI, WHY DON'T YOU QUESTION SU?"
"LIN, STOP."
YOUR SISTER WASN'T INVOLVED.
"NO, I'LL GLADLY BE QUESTIONED."
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.
WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME?
SUYIN BEIFONG.
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF TOPH
"AND THE ONLY SISTER TO LIN,"
AND I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ATTACK LAST NIGHT.
 SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.
 ARGH!
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.
JUST BRING IN THE NEXT GUARD.
GIVE ME YOUR NAME
AND TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE FROM.
I'M HONG LI.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN ZAOFU.
DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE
OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED
TO KIDNAP THE AVATAR?
NO.
DID YOU HELP THE ATTACKERS
ENTER ZAOFU LAST NIGHT?
"NO, OF COURSE NOT."
YOU'RE LYING.
"WHAT? NO, I'M NOT!"
HOW DID THEY GET IN AND OUT?
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
"I DON'T KNOW! I'M TELLING YOU,"
I DIDN'T HELP THEM.
YOU'RE A TRAITOR TO THE ENTIRE CLAN.
I SUGGEST WE SEARCH HIS PLACE.
I GOT SOMETHING.
WHAT?
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THEM.
"""TEAM ASSEMBLED."
"READY TO RENDEZVOUS."""
AND LOOK AT THIS.
THESE ARE THE GUARDS' LOG BOOKS.
ALL THEIR SCHEDULES
AND ROUTES ARE IN HERE.
THAT GUARD KNOWS EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM TO TALK.
LET'S GO CONFRONT HIM
WITH THIS EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW.
NO.
LET'S GIVE HIM A LITTLE TIME
TO SWEAT IT OUT.
HE WILL TALK EVENTUALLY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE'RE NOT TALKING
 TO THAT GUARD RIGHT NOW.
"EVERY MINUTE WE WASTE HERE,"
THOSE GUYS GET FURTHER AWAY.
"I MEAN, HOW DOES A RANDOM GUARD"
GET INVOLVED WITH A GROUP
"OF SUPER CRIMINALS, ANYWAY?"
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
"THAT GUARD IS ONLY 18 YEARS OLD,"
AND HAS LIVED IN ZAOFU HIS ENTIRE LIFE.
ZAHEER AND HIS GANG
HAVE BEEN IN PRISON
FOR MORE THAN 13 YEARS.
"I DON'T KNOW,"
BUT WE ALL SAW THE EVIDENCE.
IT'S PRETTY OVERWHELMING.
 MAYBE A LITTLE TOO OVERWHELMING?
"HEY, VARRICK."
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
COLLECTING PUMICE STONES WITH ZHU-LI.
THAT LAVABENDER DID A LOT OF DAMAGE.
BUT HE MAKES A NICE EXFOLIATING ROCK.
"AND WHEN YOU GOT CALLUSES LIKE MINE,"
YOU TAKE ALL THE PUMICE STONES
YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON.
"OR IN MY CASE, FEET!"
EHH...
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT THE EVIDENCE?
I WAS SAYING THAT I CAN SMELL
A CONSPIRACY WHEN I SEE ONE.
"LOOK, IF I WAS TRYING"
"TO SET SOMEONE UP,"
"I WOULD TELL EVERYONE HE'S GUILTY,"
AND THEN PLANT THE EVIDENCE
IN HIS APARTMENT AS PROOF.
OH. YOU MEAN EXACTLY LIKE
WHAT YOU DID TO ME?
YES! JUST LIKE THAT.
REMEMBER HOW GREAT THAT WORKED?
"WELL, NOT FOR YOU."
YOU'RE RIGHT.
"ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THIS GUARD,"
BUT MAYBE HE'S JUST THE FALL GUY.
BUT FOR WHO?
FOR THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN TRULY KEEP A SECRET
"IN THIS CITY, AIWEI."
HE'S NOT HOME. OR HE'S HIDING IN THERE.
OR HE'S INVISIBLE.
PROBABLY JUST NOT HOME.
WE HAVE TO GET IN THERE
AND FIND SOME EVIDENCE
"THAT LINKS AIWEI TO ZAHEER,"
OTHERWISE SU WON'T BELIEVE US.
IT'S JUST AN EMPTY BOOK.
"OH, IT'S LIKE A DESERT ON A JAR."
"BOLIN, PUT THAT BACK."
WE DON'T WANT AIWEI TO KNOW
WE WERE IN HERE
IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.
UH...
"YOU FORGOT WHERE IT GOES, DIDN'T YOU?"
LOOK AT THESE SCUFF MARKS.
I THINK THIS BOOKSHELF SLIDES OPEN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DOWN THERE?
COULD BE A STORAGE CELLAR.
OR IT COULD BE
HOW ZAHEER GOT IN AND OUT.
AIWEI'S COMING BACK. QUICK!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON THE PROPERTY
OF ONE OF THE HIGHEST-RANKED
OFFICIALS IN THE CITY.
YOU HAD BETTER HAVE
A GOOD EXPLANATION.
"WE DO, WE DO."
WE ACTUALLY KNOCKED
"ON YOUR FRONT DOOR,"
AND WE THOUGHT WE HEARD YOU SAY...
"""COME IN! I'M IN THE BATHROOM!"""
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M SAYING THAT.
YOU KNOW I'M LYING.
AND YOU DON'T EVEN SOUND LIKE THAT.
WE CAME HERE BECAUSE THINGS
"WEREN'T ADDING UP,"
AND WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOME ANSWERS.
SIT.
"IF YOU WANT TO TALK,"
LET'S TALK OVER SOME TEA.
"SO, WHAT IS NOT ADDING UP, EXACTLY?"
"HONG LI WAS CLEARLY LYING,"
AND WE FOUND EVIDENCE
IN HIS APARTMENT.
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S WEIRD HOW YOUNG HE IS?
HOW DID HE EVER GET
MIXED UP WITH THIS GROUP?
PERHAPS THROUGH A RELATIVE.
OR MAYBE HE WAS BRIBED.
WE WILL FIND OUT
THOSE ANSWERS IN TIME.
"BUT IF IT WASN'T HIM,"
WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS?
WE DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T THINK I HAD SOMETHING
"TO DO WITH THIS, DO YOU?"
WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.
AND YOU THINK
"YOU FOUND SOMETHING, DON'T YOU?"
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
"WHAT IS COMING FOR YOU, AVATAR."
COME ON! HE'S GETTING AWAY!
"I'M STILL A LITTLE NEW AT THIS,"
SO BACK OFF!
ARGH!
 HE'S GONE.
 LOOK.
HE MUST'VE ESCAPED THROUGH THERE.
HELP ME CLEAR IT OUT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
 WE HEARD AN EXPLOSION.
 WHERE IS AIWEI?
YOUR TRUSTED ADVISOR
WAS THE ONE WHO BETRAYED US.
 HE WAS LYING ABOUT THE GUARD.
 WHAT?
NO.
WE CONFRONTED HIM
AND HE BOLTED THROUGH HERE.
HE MUST HAVE COLLAPSED
THE TUNNEL BEHIND HIM.
AND HE RIGGED AN EXPLOSION
TO DESTROY ANY EVIDENCE
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE.
THIS IS WHERE ZAHEER GOT IN AND OUT.
AIWEI WAS THE TRAITOR.
I...
TRUSTED HIM.
 IS EVERYONE OKAY?
 AIWEI IS A FUGITIVE.
GET ALL AVAILABLE GUARDS
TO SEARCH THE MOUNTAINSIDE.
AND FIND OUT WHERE
THIS TUNNEL EXITS IMMEDIATELY!
WHAT DID YOU FIND?
"WE LOCATED THE END OF THE TUNNEL,"
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIM.
JUST SOME FRESH TIRE TRACKS.
HE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN
ALL READY TO GO.
I TRUSTED HIM WITH MY LIFE.
"I THOUGHT WE WERE FAMILY,"
BUT IT WAS ALL A LIE.
"WHOEVER THESE GUYS ARE,"
THEY'RE MORE POWERFUL
THAN WE THOUGHT.
AND MORE DANGEROUS.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO FIND THEM.
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OFF
OUR SEARCH FOR AIRBENDERS
AND HUNT DOWN AIWEI.
NAGA CAN TRACK HIS SCENT.
AND I BET IF WE FIND AIWEI
WE'LL FIND ZAHEER.
NO.
WE'RE NOT HUNTING THIS GROUP.
THERE COULD BE OTHER SECRET AGENTS
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
LOOKING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY
WHERE I CAN PROTECT YOU.
"IF I WASN'T SAFE HERE,"
THEN I'M NOT SAFE ANYWHERE.
I HAVE TO STOP THEM.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
YOU ARE NOT GOING!
STOP TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
I'M THE AVATAR. THIS IS MY JOB!
DON'T LECTURE ME ABOUT JOBS!
"ENOUGH. KORRA, LISTEN TO LIN."
BUT THEY...
PLEASE. LIN'S ONLY
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
I PROMISE YOU AIWEI
AND EVERYONE HE'S WORKING WITH
WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.
FINE. IF YOU REALLY THINK IT'S BEST.
I DO.
"THANK YOU, SU."
EVERYONE SHOULD
GET SOME REST TONIGHT.
I'LL HAVE MY PEOPLE PREP YOUR AIRSHIP
AND YOU CAN LEAVE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
SU.
YOU REALLY THINK
NAGA COULD TRACK AIWEI?
 DEFINITELY.
 THEN HERE.
THERE'S A JEEP PACKED
WITH SUPPLIES BY THE EAST GATE.
IT'S ALL GASSED UP AND READY TO GO.
WHAT? WHY?
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO HUNT DOWN AIWEI
AND BRING HIM BACK TO ME.
BUT YOU SAID...
"I SAID WHAT LIN WANTED TO HEAR,"
AND I BOUGHT YOU GUYS SOME TIME.
GO. I'LL DEAL WITH LIN
IN THE MORNING.
LET'S GET THIS GUY.
THANKS.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 ZAHEER INFILTRATED ZAOFU
AND ATTEMPTED TO KIDNAP
THE AVATAR.
"AFTER A HARROWING BATTLE,"
"KORRA WAS SAVED,"
BUT SHE SOON DISCOVERED
A SHOCKING TRUTH.
"AIWEI, SU'S TRUSTED ADVISOR,"
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH ZAHEER.
THIS TRUTH SEER TURNED TRAITOR
"MANAGED TO ESCAPE,"
BUT SU TASKS TEAM AVATAR
WITH TRACKING HIM DOWN.
NOW THE HUNTED
BECOMES THE HUNTER
AS KORRA SEARCHES FOR ANSWERS.
 AIWEI'S DEFINITELY BEEN
THROUGH HERE.
"NICE TRACKING, GIRL."
 LET'S ASK AROUND.
MAYBE SOMEONE'S SEEN HIM.
" OOH, LOOK,"
THEY HAVE A MOVER POSTER OF ME.
MUST BE BIG NUKTUK FANS. YEAH.
I SHOULD GO OVER AND SAY HELLO.
" NO, THOSE ARE WANTED POSTERS,"
AND THERE'S ONE FOR EACH OF US.
"""WANTED BY HER MAJESTY,"
"THE EARTH QUEEN,"
"FOR CRIMES AGAINST THE KINGDOM."""
I'M GUESSING THIS IS BECAUSE
WE TOOK HER AIRBENDERS.
 THEY WEREN'T HERS TO KEEP.
"I SWEAR, IF I EVER SEE HER PINCHY"
"LITTLE QUEEN FACE AGAIN,"
I AM GONNA...
" UH, GUYS."
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.
 WHERE IS EVERYONE?
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO LEAVE
FOR HALF AN HOUR.
 AND GOOD MORNING
"TO YOU TOO, LIN."
"NOW, DON'T GET MAD."
KORRA'S FINE.
I'M JUST WAITING TO HEAR
IF SHE TRACKED DOWN AIWEI YET.
 WHAT? YOU LET KORRA GO?
I THOUGHT WE WERE
"ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THIS,"
AND THEN YOU GO STAB ME
IN THE BACK?
" OH, DON'T BE SO OVERDRAMATIC."
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
THE AVATAR'S EVERY MOVE.
 I CAN TRY.
 NAGA FOUND SOMETHING.
"OH, SORRY."
I FORGOT TO BRING TREATS.
BUT GOOD GIRL.
 THIS MUST BE AIWEI'S JEEP.
HE CAN'T BE FAR.
 BOLIN AND I WILL INVESTIGATE
THE MISTY PALMS OASIS
AND SEE IF HE'S HOLED UP THERE.
" YES, I LOVE IT"
WHEN YOU TALK LIKE A COP.
 I'M COMING TOO.
 NO.
YOU AND ASAMI WAIT HERE
IN CASE HE COMES BACK.
"BESIDES, WE DON'T WANT TO CALL TOO"
MUCH ATTENTION TO OURSELVES.
 ALL RIGHT.
 OOH.
"MAKO, MAKO, MAKO,"
WE SHOULD WEAR DISGUISES
AND PRETEND
WE'RE GOING UNDERCOVER.
"THAT WAY,"
NO ONE WILL RECOGNIZE US.
POLICE WORK IS SO EXCITING.
"ALL RIGHT, NOW WE NEED"
OUR UNDERCOVER IDENTITIES.
I'M AN EX-UNITED FORCES
OPERATIVE NAMED TING-TING.
WAR WAS THE ONLY WOMAN
"I EVER LOVED,"
UNTIL IVY CAME ALONG
AND SHOWED ME WHAT REAL LOVE IS.
"TRAGICALLY,"
SHE WAS TAKEN FROM ME
"BY MY ARCHENEMY DR. RAZOR,"
AND HE...
 ENOUGH. LET'S JUST FIND AIWEI.
 BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOU
YOUR BACKSTORY.
 I'M A COP.
I DON'T HAVE A BACKSTORY.
" OOH, YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS."
 SHOO. HUMAN CUSTOMERS ONLY.
 LET'S SEE IF THIS GUY
KNOWS ANYTHING.
"EXCUSE ME, SIR."
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN
"ABOUT 60, BALDING,"
WEARING GLASSES
AND A LONG GREEN ROBE.
 AND HE'S GOT
THIS WEIRD PIERCING
THAT GOES FROM HIS NOSE
TO HIS EAR.
FREAKS ME OUT.
" YEAH, SURE."
SOUNDS LIKE A GUY
WHO CAME IN LAST NIGHT.
I TOLD HIM I HAD
"THE BEST DRINKS IN THE EARTH KINGDOM,"
AND HE CALLED ME A LIAR.
 THAT'S HIM.
ANY IDEA WHERE HE IS NOW?
" NO, AFRAID NOT."
BUT HE WAS RIGHT.
MY DRINKS ARE TERRIBLE.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
 I'M JUST FRUSTRATED.
WHAT DOES ZAHEER WANT WITH ME?
WHAT'S HIS PLAN?
" I DON'T KNOW,"
BUT I THINK I FOUND A CLUE.
" ""XAI BAU'S GROVE, SUNDOWN."""
THIS MUST BE WHERE AND WHEN
AIWEI'S GOING TO MEET ZAHEER.
" ALL RIGHT, XAI BAU'S GROVE,"
WHERE ARE YOU?
GO AWAY.
I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING.
" WELL, AREN'T YOU"
A CUTE LITTLE...
OW! HEY!
 NO LUCK HERE.
 I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
A COUPLE BOUNTY HUNTERS
OVER THERE WHO RECOGNIZE ME.
 WE'VE BEEN MADE.
LET'S LOSE 'EM.
"OKAY, I THINK WE'RE CLEAR."
WE SHOULD HEAD BACK TO KORRA
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE
RECOGNIZES US.
" WE COULD, OR"
WE COULD FOLLOW AIWEI INSTEAD.
LOOK.
" ALL RIGHT, PLAY IT COOL."
FOLLOW MY LEAD.
 TING-TING
ALWAYS FINDS HIS MAN.
 KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
I'LL GO GET KORRA.
WE FOUND AIWEI HIDING IN AN INN.
 THAT'S GREAT.
WE FOUND SOMETHING TOO.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING
TO MEET ZAHEER AT SUNDOWN
AT A PLACE
"CALLED XAI BAU'S GROVE,"
BUT I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
ON THE MAP.
 LET'S GO BUST
AIWEI'S DOOR DOWN
AND FINALLY GET SOME ANSWERS.
" NO, ONCE AIWEI KNOWS"
"WE'RE ON TO HIM,"
WE LOSE OUR ADVANTAGE.
"I SAY WE STAKE OUT HIS ROOM,"
AND WHEN HE LEAVES
"FOR THIS MEETING,"
WE FOLLOW HIM.
 AND HE'LL LEAD US
STRAIGHT TO ZAHEER.
 GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'D LIKE A ROOM
ON THE GROUND FLOOR
"ACROSS FROM 102, PLEASE."
 FORGET IT. LAST TIME A BUNCH OF
"TEENAGERS CAME IN HERE,"
THEY TRASHED THE WHOLE ROOM.
 WE FOUND YOU.
" HEY, NO BENDING IN HERE."
TAKE IT OUTSIDE.
" WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA."
WE'RE NOT HERE TO FIGHT YOU.
WE'RE HERE TO MEET NUKTUK.
 WE'RE YOUR BIGGEST FANS.
COULD YOU MAKE IT OUT
TO LILY AND MACAO?
" UH, I'D BE HAPPY TO."
ALWAYS LOVE MEETING MY FANS.
 I MADE THIS NUKTUK DOLL
FOR YOU.
" AW, IT'S CUTE."
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR FRIEND WAS A MOVER STAR?
I'D BE HAPPY TO RENT YOU
ANY ROOM IN THE INN.
 WE'LL JUST TAKE THE ONE
ACROSS FROM 102.
 BUT THAT ROOM IS TOO SMALL
FOR THE FOUR OF YOU.
 TRUST ME. IT'LL BE PERFECT.
 I'D JUST LIKE TO STATE
FOR THE RECORD
THAT THIS ROOM IS NOT PERFECT.
NAGA!
 THERE HE IS.
 I THOUGHT STAKEOUTS
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCITING.
THIS ISN'T AT ALL.
"OOH, I WONDER"
IF THERE'S ANY SNACKS IN HERE.
"HEY, LOOK!"
A PAI SHO BOARD.
"MAKO, YOU WANT TO PLAY?"
" KIND OF BUSY HERE, BRO."
 I'LL PLAY.
" OH, WELL..."
"NO OFFENSE, BUT I LEARNED"
"STREET PAI SHO FROM SHADY SHIN,"
"AND I AM PRETTY GOOD,"
SO WOULDN'T REALLY BE
A FAIR GAME.
 SO? I LEARNED TO PLAY
"FROM MY DAD,"
THE DIABOLICAL GENIUS.
I'LL DESTROY YOU.
" WELL, LOOKS LIKE"
WE HAVE OURSELVES
A PAI SHO-DOWN.
LADIES FIRST.
 HMM.
" I DON'T WANT TO RUSH YOU,"
BUT LET'S SPEED THINGS UP A BIT.
 WHY?
"THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT SLOW,"
METHODICAL STRATEGY.
" NO, IT'S NOT;"
"THIS IS A FAST-PACED,"
EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT
GAME OF CHANCE.
DON'T THINK. JUST GO.
 I DON'T KNOW
"WHAT SHADY SHIN TAUGHT YOU,"
BUT IT WASN'T THE REAL PAI SHO.
" OH, REALLY?"
I THINK OUR FRIEND MR. RULE BOOK
MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU.
"""THE ORIGINS OF PAI SHO"
"DATE BACK OVER 10,000 YEARS."
IT IS A GAME OF BOTH STRATEGY
"AND CHANCE."""
"WAIT, HOW COULD IT BE BOTH?"
 LET ME SEE THAT.
"""THERE HAVE BEEN"
COUNTLESS VARIATIONS
"""OF PAI SHO"
"THROUGH THE CENTURIES,"
"""AND EACH CULTURE"
HAS ITS OWN RULES
"AND VARIATIONS ON THE GAME."""
 THAT'S NO HELP AT ALL.
"KORRA, AS THE AVATAR,"
YOU NEED TO STANDARDIZE
THESE PAI SHO RULES.
 OKAY. I'LL PUT THAT
ON MY TO-DO LIST
"RIGHT AFTER ""BRINGING BACK"
"THE AIR NATION"""
"AND ""TAKING DOWN THE GROUP"
"THAT TRIED TO KIDNAP ME."""
 THAT'S COOL.
WHENEVER YOU GET TO IT.
" ASSUMING WE DO FIND ZAHEER,"
WHAT THEN?
 THEN I MAKE HIM TALK.
 HE WAS LOCKED AWAY
"FOR 13 YEARS, KORRA,"
AND NEVER BROKE.
I DON'T THINK A LITTLE BENDING
IS GOING TO INTIMIDATE THIS GUY.
 YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?
" YEAH, WE SPY ON THEM."
IF AIWEI AND ZAHEER DON'T KNOW
"THEY'RE BEING WATCHED,"
THEY'LL TALK FREELY.
THEN WE'LL KNOW WHO THEY ARE
AND WHAT THEY WANT.
 THAT'S JUST LIKE PAI SHO.
"""IN ORDER TO DEFEAT"
"YOUR OPPONENT,"
YOU FIRST HAVE TO KNOW
"YOUR OPPONENT."""
 THEN I GUESS
I KNOW YOU PRETTY WELL.
I WIN.
 WHAT?
"ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT."
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT WAS JUST A FLUKE.
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE.
"OH, COME ON!"
BEST FOUR OUT OF SEVEN.
8 OUT OF 15.
17 OUT OF 33?
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ON THE ROPES THIS TIME.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN THIS ONE.
" NO, PABU!"
WHY?
 IT'S ALMOST SUNDOWN.
WHY HASN'T AIWEI LEFT YET?
 MAYBE HE SLIPPED OUT
WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING.
" NO, I JUST SAW HIM"
PEEKING OUT THE WINDOW
15 MINUTES AGO.
IT'S IN MY LOGBOOK.
 I'M GOING OVER THERE.
" KORRA, WAIT."
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW
OUR ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
" IT'S OVER, AIWEI. WHERE'S..."
WHAT?
 THAT'S A WEIRD WAY TO NAP.
 HE'S NOT SLEEPING.
HE'S MEDITATING. WAIT.
"ASAMI, THOSE SPIRITS WERE TRYING TO"
TELL US SOMETHING EARLIER.
XAI BAU'S GROVE ISN'T ON THE MAP
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD.
IT'S IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
I'M GOING IN AFTER HIM.
 WE'LL WATCH HIM
IN CASE HE WAKES UP.
BE CAREFUL.
 WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN ZAOFU?
YOU TOLD ME
WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
GETTING THE AVATAR.
"BECAUSE OF YOU,"
WE'VE ALL BEEN COMPROMISED.
" NO, ANY EVIDENCE WAS DESTROYED"
WHEN MY LIBRARY BURNED.
 WHERE IS
YOUR PHYSICAL BODY NOW?
 AT THE MISTY PALMS INN.
BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY.
I WAS NOT FOLLOWED.
 YOU LEFT A LOOSE END.
 I ASSURE YOU
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT US.
" NO, YOU ARE THE LOOSE END."
 ZAHEER!
 IT SEEMS AIWEI WAS MISTAKEN.
HE WAS FOLLOWED.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
WE KNEW HE'D LEAD US
STRAIGHT TO YOU.
SO WHAT DID YOU DO WITH HIM?
 HE'LL BE SPENDING ETERNITY
"IN THE FOG OF LOST SOULS,"
WHICH JUST LEAVES THE TWO OF US.
" DON'T MOVE, ZAHEER."
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
SOME ANSWERS.
 THERE'S NO NEED
FOR AGGRESSION.
"NEITHER OF US HAS OUR BENDING,"
AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I'LL ANSWER
WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.
YOU DESERVE THAT MUCH.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?
" FIRST OFF, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE,"
AND WHY DO YOU KEEP
TRYING TO TAKE ME?
 WE ARE PART
OF A SECRET SOCIETY
DEDICATED TO RESTORING FREEDOM
TO THE WORLD.
WE ARE THE RED LOTUS.
 RED LOTUS?
ARE YOU RELATED
TO THE WHITE LOTUS?
 WE ARE WHAT THE WHITE LOTUS
"WAS MEANT TO BE,"
"BUT AFTER THE HUNDRED YEAR WAR,"
THE WHITE LOTUS
LOST ITS TRUE PURPOSE.
ITS MEMBERS CAME OUT OF HIDING
AND OPENLY SERVED THE AVATAR.
THEY BECAME NOTHING
BUT GLORIFIED BODYGUARDS
"WHO SERVED CORRUPT NATIONS,"
SO A GREAT MAN NAMED XAI BAU
BROKE FROM THE WHITE LOTUS
AND BEGAN HIS OWN SOCIETY.
" THAT'S A GREAT STORY,"
BUT IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY YOU TRIED TO TAKE ME
WHEN I WAS A KID.
 THAT WAS UNALAQ'S IDEA.
 WHAT?
MY UNCLE WAS PART
OF THE RED LOTUS?
 AVATAR KORRA.
MISTY PALMS INN.
FIND HER.
 YOU TWO GO.
I'LL STAY HERE AND MAKE SURE
ZAHEER'S BODY IS SAFE.
 I MET YOUR UNCLE
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER
AFTER WE HAD BOTH JOINED
THE RED LOTUS.
WE LEARNED ABOUT RAAVA AND VAATU
AND HOW AVATAR WAN
"FOOLISHLY SEVERED THEM,"
DISRUPTING THE BALANCE
OF THE WORLD FOREVER.
 AVATAR WAN WASN'T FOOLISH.
HE WAS TRYING
TO RESTORE BALANCE.
" HE CLOSED THE PORTALS,"
SEVERING HUMANS FROM SPIRITS.
EVEN YOU REALIZE
THE ERROR IN HIS WAYS.
" SO ALL ALONG,"
YOU AND MY UNCLE PLANNED TO USE ME
TO OPEN THE PORTALS
AND RELEASE VAATU?
THAT'S WHY YOU
TRIED TO TAKE ME WHEN I WAS A KID?
" YES, AND WITH MEMBERS"
OF THE RED LOTUS
"AS YOUR ELEMENTAL MASTERS,"
WE COULD'VE TAUGHT YOU SO MUCH.
 SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANTED
TO BRAINWASH ME
SO I'D DO WHATEVER YOU WANTED.
" NO, KORRA."
ALL I WANTED
WAS TO SHOW THE AVATAR
A BETTER PATH FOR THE WORLD.
" UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW,"
BUT WATER ARM LADY
AND LAVA GUY FOUND US.
 HOW?
 I JUST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW.
" KORRA, COME ON, WAKE UP."
 WHAT DO WE DO?
 GET KORRA OUT OF HERE.
BOLIN AND I WILL HOLD THEM OFF.
 THE AVATAR.
 IF MY UNCLE CAME UP
WITH A PLAN
"TO ABDUCT ME WHEN I WAS A KID,"
WHY WASN'T HE CAUGHT?
" HE WASN'T WITH US THAT NIGHT,"
AND HE COVERED UP
HIS INVOLVEMENT AFTERWARDS.
 SO HE BETRAYED YOU
JUST LIKE HE BETRAYED ME.
" YES, HE ALLOWED ME"
AND MY FRIENDS
TO REMAIN IMPRISONED
WHILE HE PURSUED
HIS OWN SELFISH GOALS.
UNALAQ BECOMING A DARK AVATAR
WAS NEVER PART OF OUR MISSION.
 AND WHAT IS YOUR MISSION
EXACTLY?
" I WANT WHAT YOU WANT,"
TO RESTORE BALANCE
TO THIS WORLD.
 I DON'T THINK OUR IDEAS
OF BALANCE ARE THE SAME.
 ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
YOU KEPT
"THE SPIRIT PORTALS OPEN,"
BUT WHY STOP THERE?
BRINGING THE SPIRITS BACK
SHOULD ONLY BE THE BEGINNING.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 THE IDEA OF HAVING NATIONS
AND GOVERNMENTS
IS AS FOOLISH AS KEEPING
THE HUMAN
AND SPIRIT REALMS SEPARATE.
YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL
WITH A MORONIC PRESIDENT
AND A TYRANNICAL QUEEN.
DON'T YOU THINK THE WORLD
WOULD BE BETTER OFF
IF LEADERS LIKE THEM
WERE ELIMINATED?
 NO.
"I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY AGREE"
"WITH WHAT THEY'VE DONE,"
BUT TAKING OUT WORLD LEADERS
ISN'T THE ANSWER.
 IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO
THAT THE AIRBENDERS
WERE NEARLY ALL WIPED OUT
THANKS TO THE FIRE LORD'S DESIRE
FOR WORLD DOMINANCE.
TRUE FREEDOM
CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED
WHEN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS
ARE TORN DOWN.
 BUT THAT WON'T BRING BALANCE.
IT WILL THROW THE WORLD
INTO CHAOS.
 EXACTLY.
THE NATURAL ORDER IS DISORDER.
"DO YOU KNOW WHO ONCE SAID,"
"""NEW GROWTH CANNOT EXIST"
WITHOUT FIRST
"THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD""?"
 NO.
" THE WISE GURU LAGHIMA,"
AN AIRBENDER.
I CAN'T BEAT THIS GUY.
IT'S LIKE I'M GIVING HIM AMMO.
WANT TO TRADE?
 GO GET THE AVATAR.
I HAVE THESE TWO UNDER CONTROL.
" YOU KNOW, BEING LOCKED AWAY"
"FOR SO MANY YEARS,"
"I WAS BEGINNING TO LOSE HOPE,"
BUT WHEN I AWOKE
"WITH AIRBENDING,"
I KNEW I WOULD BE THE ONE
TO DESTROY THE OLD WORLD
AND PLANT SEEDS
FOR A NEW WORLD TO FLOURISH.
" ZAHEER, PLEASE,"
"AS AN AIRBENDER,"
YOU COULD HELP MAKE A POSITIVE
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
INSTEAD OF DESTROYING IT.
 YOU'RE A VERY SMART
"YOUNG WOMAN, KORRA,"
BUT YOU MUST REALIZE
"THAT ONCE CHANGE BEGINS,"
"IT CANNOT BE STOPPED,"
EVEN BY THE AVATAR.
 ENOUGH WITH
YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL MUMBO JUMBO.
I WANT TO KNOW ONE THING:
"IF YOU DO CAPTURE ME,"
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ME?
 YOU'LL HAVE THAT ANSWER
SOON ENOUGH.
THE RED LOTUS
SHOULD HAVE YOU BY NOW.
SEE YOU IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD.
 ZAHEER!
"ZAHEER, YOU TRICKED ME."
LET ME GO!
"ASAMI, ARE YOU OKAY?"
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE RED LOTUS?
 WHAT'S THE RED LOTUS?
AND ZAHEER DIDN'T CAPTURE US.
THE EARTH QUEEN'S FORCES DID.
 WHERE ARE WE?
 I'M NOT SURE.
SOME CAMP BY THE DESERT.
THEY'RE TAKING US BACK
TO BA SING SE.
 THE EARTH QUEEN'S ARMY
SNATCHED UP THE AVATAR
BEFORE I COULD.
 BUT WE FIGURED
YOU COULD FIND A USE FOR THESE TWO.
 LOAD THEM IN THE TRUCK.
WE'RE TAKING A TRIP
TO BA SING SE.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 THE RED LOTUS IS
THE WORLD'S NEWEST THREAT.
"AFTER CONFRONTING ZAHEER,"
KORRA LEARNED HE IS PART
OF A SECRET SOCIETY
WHOSE MISSION IS TO TAKE OUT
ALL THE NATION'S LEADERS
AND DESTROY WORLD ORDER.
BUT BEFORE KORRA
"COULD WARN ANYONE,"
SHE AND ASAMI WERE APPREHENDED
BY THE EARTH QUEEN'S FORCES.
AND THE RED LOTUS
NABBED MAKO AND BOLIN.
NOW BOTH PARTIES ARE HEADED
TOWARD BA SING SE.
YOU HAVE TO LET ME OUT.
THE EARTH QUEEN IS IN DANGER
FROM A GROUP OF TERRORISTS
CALLING THEMSELVES
THE RED LOTUS.
I TALKED TO ONE OF THEM
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD YESTERDAY.
HE'S INSANE.
 SCREAMING ABOUT TERRORISTS
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD?
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SOUNDS INSANE.
 DO I HAVE TO BE CHAINED
TO THE FLOOR THE WHOLE WAY?
IT'S GOING TO BE
SO UNCOMFORTABLE.
" SORRY, MA'AM."
I'M UNDER ORDERS.
 CAN'T YOU JUST CHAIN ME
TO THAT RAILING?
"I MEAN, WHERE AM I GONNA GO?"
PLEASE.
" WELL, AS LONG AS"
"YOU'RE CHAINED UP,"
I GUESS IT DOESN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
" THANK YOU, SIR."
 CAN I HAVE SOME WATER?
 NO WATER.
WE'RE ALSO NOT GONNA BRING YOU
"ANY ROCKS OR FIRE,"
SO DON'T ASK.
"I GUESS THERE'S AIR,"
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT.
WE'RE NOT OPENING
YOUR COMPARTMENT
UNTIL WE REACH BA SING SE.
 I HOPED MAKO AND BOLIN
WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP
TO SAVE US BY NOW.
I WONDER IF THEY'RE OKAY.
 IF YOU THINK
HOLDING US HOSTAGE
WILL GIVE YOU SOME LEVERAGE
"TO USE AGAINST THE AVATAR,"
YOU'RE GONNA BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.
 CAN'T WE JUST ENJOY OUR TIME
TOGETHER IN SILENCE?
 AND WHY DID YOU NEED
KORRA ALIVE BACK IN ZAOFU?
YOU HAD HER PARALYZED.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TAKE HER OUT
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE?
" LOOK, ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW"
IS THAT THE WORLD
"IS ABOUT TO CHANGE,"
FOR THE BETTER.
" SO YOU GUYS WERE, LIKE,"
"LOCKED UP FOR 15 YEARS, HUH?"
"THAT MUST HAVE BEEN, LIKE,"
CRAZY BORING.
" ACTUALLY,"
"IT WAS ONLY 13 YEARS,"
BUT IT FELT LIKE 30.
" I MEAN, WHAT DID YOU DO"
WITH ALL THAT TIME?
"DID YOU SING SONGS,"
WORK ON CRAFTS?
 NOT A LOT OF CRAFT SUPPLIES
IN A VOLCANIC PRISON CELL.
 AND I MUST HAVE RENAMED
THE CONSTELLATIONS
ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES.
"WHEN IT RAINED,"
THAT WAS A BIG EVENT.
" OH, I WOULD'VE KILLED"
FOR SOME RAIN.
MOSTLY I JUST MADE UP STORIES
ABOUT THE GUARDS.
WHO WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND?
WHICH ONE SECRETLY WISHED
HE'D BECOME A PASTRY CHEF?
" OOH, OKAY,"
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
LET ME TRY THAT ON YOU GUYS.
YOU WERE RAISED
BY AN OLDER SISTER.
YOUR MUSTACHE GREW IN
WHEN YOU WERE TEN.
AND I'M SENSING...
JUST SENSING...
AN UNSPOKEN ATTRACTION
BETWEEN YOU TWO.
 TWO OUT OF THREE. NOT BAD.
" BOLIN, WILL YOU STOP MAKING"
FRIENDS WITH THE BAD GUYS?
 SORRY.
" GHAZAN, GAG THOSE TWO."
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
OUT OF THIS PRISON
BEFORE WE GET
TO THE EARTH QUEEN.
 DON'T WORRY. I HAVE A PLAN.
THESE AIRSHIPS THAT CABBAGE CORP
SOLD TO THE EARTH KINGDOM
ARE WAY CHEAPER THAN THE ONES
FUTURE INDUSTRIES BUILT.
"NOW, THAT'S JUST"
SHODDY WORKMANSHIP.
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GET
THESE LOCKS OFF.
I NEED THE KEYS.
"GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES,"
THEN START YELLING FOR HELP.
 WHEN IS THE AVATAR
SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY?
 THE AIRSHIP ALREADY
LEFT FORT BOSCO
AND SHOULD BE ARRIVING
IN A FEW HOURS.
 EXCELLENT.
BRING HER TO ME
AS SOON AS IT LANDS.
" YES, YOUR MAJESTY."
BUT FIRST THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE HERE
WHO CAPTURED
TWO OF THE AVATAR'S FRIENDS.
THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT
THEM TO YOU PERSONALLY.
 YOU KNOW I DON'T MEET
WITH BOUNTY HUNTERS.
 AND OF COURSE
"I TOLD THEM THAT,"
BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE
SOME INFORMATION
THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU
ABOUT THE LOCATION
OF YOUR STOLEN AIRBENDERS.
 REALLY?
"FINE, SEND THEM IN."
"AH, YES."
I REMEMBER THESE TWO.
WE'LL FIND AN ACCEPTABLE HOME
FOR YOU IN PRISON
WITH THE REST OF THE DISSIDENTS.
NOW I'M TOLD YOU HAVE
SOME INFORMATION FOR ME.
I HOPE THIS ISN'T JUST SOME RUSE
TO TRY TO INCREASE YOUR BOUNTY.
" WE DON'T WANT ANY BOUNTY,"
YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU CAN CONSIDER THESE TWO
A THANK-YOU GIFT
FOR SIMPLY TAKING THE TIME
TO TALK TO US.
 HOW VERY MAGNANIMOUS.
SO WHERE ARE MY AIRBENDERS?
 I'D BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU
ONCE YOU HAND
THE AVATAR OVER TO ME.
 WHO TOLD YOU
THAT WE HAVE THE AVATAR?
 HOW I KNOW IS NOT IMPORTANT.
"BUT IF I FOUND OUT,"
OTHERS WILL TOO.
AND THAT COULD PUT YOU
IN A DIFFICULT POSITION.
 IS THAT SO?
" YOUR MAJESTY,"
IMPRISONING THE AVATAR
WILL CAUSE THE OTHER NATIONS
TO TURN AGAINST YOU
AND DEMAND HER FREEDOM.
"BEFORE LONG,"
YOU'LL BE IN THE MIDST
OF A STICKY
INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.
BUT IF YOU LET ME
"TAKE HER TODAY,"
NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW
"SHE WAS HERE,"
AND YOU CAN GET YOUR AIRBENDERS
BACK WITHOUT INTERFERENCE.
WE BOTH WIN.
 AND WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO
"WITH THE AVATAR,"
SHOULD I SEE FIT
TO GRANT YOUR REQUEST?
 ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT
I HAVE BUSINESS WITH HER.
BUT SHE WON'T
BE BOTHERING YOU AGAIN.
I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.
 I FIND THESE TERMS AGREEABLE.
"GUN, ESCORT THEM"
TO THE ANTECHAMBER
UNTIL THE AVATAR'S ARRIVAL.
SEND THESE TWO TO THE DUNGEON.
 GUARD! GET IN HERE!
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY FRIEND!
SHE NEEDS HELP!
 WHERE IS SHE?
 NICE WORK.
NOW LET'S TAKE CONTROL
OF THIS SHIP.
" MAYDAY, MAYDAY."
THE AVATAR HAS ESCAPED.
WE'RE GOING DOWN
IN QUADRANT FOUR
OF THE SI WONG DESERT.
 I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE OVERAGGRESSIVE
WITH THE AIRBENDING.
THE CONTROLS ARE BUSTED.
"ALSO, YOU BROKE THE RADIO."
" SORRY, BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT"
THIS AIRSHIP'S A HUNK OF JUNK.
 HANG ON TO SOMETHING!
" WELL, THEY SAY ANY LANDING"
YOU CAN WALK AWAY FROM
IS A GOOD LANDING.
"BUT GIVEN OUR LOCATION,"
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.
 YOU'RE THE ENGINEER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
CAN WE GET IT FLYING AGAIN?
 IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
"I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU METALBEND THE"
"PROPELLERS BACK INTO SHAPE,"
WE'D HAVE TO DIG THIS
WHOLE THING OUT OF THE SAND.
 IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?
 LIKE YOU CARE.
 WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?
 SHE SAID
HER FRIEND NEEDED HELP.
THEN THEY KNOCKED ME OUT!
" I'M SORRY, BUT I COULDN'T"
LET YOU TAKE ME
TO THE EARTH QUEEN AS A CAPTIVE.
THERE ARE
DANGEROUS FORCES AT WORK
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT.
 MORE DANGEROUS THAN BEING
STRANDED IN THE DESERT?
" DON'T WORRY, KONG."
I RADIOED BA SING SE
BEFORE WE WENT DOWN.
WE JUST NEED TO SIT TIGHT.
SOMEONE WILL BE HERE SOON
TO RESCUE US.
 I'M NOT WAITING AROUND
FOR THAT.
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW.
" IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER,"
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET
THE SHIP UP AND RUNNING.
 NOT LIKELY.
I JUST TUNNELED OUT
OF THE ENGINE ROOM.
IT'S LIKE A SANDBOX IN THERE.
 THIS SHIP
"ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE,"
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.
"YOU'RE OUR PRISONERS,"
AND IT'S OUR DUTY
TO TRANSPORT YOU
TO THE EARTH QUEEN.
 YOU REALIZE
"THAT I'M THE AVATAR, RIGHT?"
YOU DON'T WANNA FIGHT ME.
 I'M AFRAID YOU AREN'T
GIVING US MUCH OF A CHOICE.
WE HAVE OUR ORDERS.
" WAIT, DID THAT SAND DUNE"
JUST MOVE?
 IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A MIRAGE.
THE DESERT WILL PLAY
TRICKS ON YOU.
 THAT'S NO MIRAGE.
LOOK.
 I HEARD THAT SINCE
"ALL THE SPIRITS CAME BACK,"
THIS DESERT HAS BEEN
HAUNTED BY THEM.
" OH, RIGHT, SO I GUESS"
THAT'S MY FAULT TOO.
DO YOU WANT TO HELP US
"GET THIS SHIP UP AND RUNNING,"
OR DO YOU WANNA WAIT AROUND
AND MEET THAT THING?
" WE WANNA FIX THE SHIP,"
"RIGHT, CAP?"
" MMM, LET'S GET TO WORK."
" EVERYBODY, STAND BACK!"
 WE HAVE TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE
BEFORE ZAHEER GETS
HIS HANDS ON KORRA.
 TAKE ME WITH YOU.
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY WIFE
AND FIVE KIDS IN FOUR YEARS.
 FOUR YEARS?
 THE FIRST FEW MONTHS
WERE GREAT.
I COULD FINALLY GET SOME SLEEP.
BUT NOW I REALLY MISS THEM.
" LISTEN, BOLIN,"
THIS IS UP TO YOU.
I KNOW YOU CAN METALBEND.
 YOU CAN METALBEND?
 NO.
" YES, YOU CAN."
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
" I BELIEVE IN YOU TOO, BOLIN!"
" I APPRECIATE THAT,"
"MAKO AND FELLOW PRISONER MAN,"
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING
"AND TRYING AND TRYING,"
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO DO IT... NOT EVEN A LITTLE.
 YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
THE ABILITY DEEP DOWN.
YOU JUST HAVEN'T HAD
THE RIGHT MOTIVATION.
BUT THIS IS YOUR TIME.
GET US OUT OF HERE
TO SAVE KORRA.
YOU CAN DO IT!
BOLIN! BOLIN!
BOLIN! BOLIN! BOLIN! BOLIN!
 YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY.
HERE I GO.
METALBENDING!
AGHH!
I CAN'T METALBEND.
AWW.
" HEY, YOU GUYS"
DIDN'T HAPPEN TO BRING
"ANY TOILET PAPER, DID YOU?"
 FIRST YOU SCARE
"THE LIFE OUT OF ME,"
NOW YOU WANT TO LICK ME.
"HERE. CHEW ON THIS,"
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.
"TONRAQ, YOU READ ME?"
 YES. WE COPY.
" I FOUND KORRA'S JEEP,"
BUT THE KIDS AREN'T HERE.
MEET ME
AT THE MISTY PALMS OASIS.
 HOW'S IT LOOKING IN THERE?
 I JUST AIRBENT ALL THE SAND
OUT OF THE ENGINE ROOM.
I THINK IT'S CLEAN.
 IT HASN'T BEEN THAT CLEAN SINCE IT
FLOATED OFF THE SHOWROOM FLOOR.
 HOW'S IT GOING OUT HERE?
" WELL, SHE'S STILL"
"PRETTY BANGED UP,"
BUT I THINK SHE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO LIMP OUT OF THE DESERT.
"KONG, YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOU"
CAN GET THE ENGINE STARTED?
" AYE, AYE."
 ALL RIGHT!
 AAH!
THAT'S NO SPIRIT.
I THINK IT'S GONE FOR NOW.
" KONG, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
ALL OF OUR SUPPLIES
WERE ON THE SHIP.
"WE'VE GOT NO FOOD, NO WATER."
" EASY, ARIK."
ANOTHER SHIP IS ON THE WAY.
WE JUST NEED TO HOLD
OUR POSITION FOR A FEW HOURS.
 WE MIGHT NOT HAVE A FEW HOURS.
 HOW FAR ARE WE
FROM THE EDGE OF THE DESERT?
" TOO FAR TO WALK,"
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
 WE CAN'T JUST
WAIT AROUND FOR THAT THING
TO PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE!
" YOU'LL DO AS YOU'RE TOLD,"
AIRMAN.
NOW GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF!
 MAYBE WE CAN STILL
BUILD SOMETHING
TO GET US ALL OUT OF HERE.
 YOU WANNA MAKE SOME WINGS
OUT OF SCRAP METAL
AND FLAP REAL HARD?
" NO, BUT WE MIGHT"
HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL
TO CONSTRUCT
"A MAKESHIFT SAND-SAILER,"
LIKE THE SANDBENDERS
USE TO GET AROUND.
ALL WE NEED IS A SAIL AND SOME
KIND OF SLED TO ATTACH IT TO.
 IT'S WORTH A TRY.
 GATHER EVERY PIECE
OF METAL YOU CAN FIND.
WE'LL GIVE THAT SANDY BEAST
A RUN FOR HIS MONEY YET.
 LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN A HURRY.
WAIT HERE.
" YOUR MAJESTY,"
WE RECEIVED A DISTRESS SIGNAL
FROM THE AIRSHIP
CARRYING THE PRISONERS.
WE BELIEVE THE SHIP CRASHED
IN THE SI WONG DESERT
AND THE AVATAR MAY HAVE ESCAPED.
 THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!
SEND ANOTHER AIRSHIP
TO RETRIEVE THE AVATAR IMMEDIATELY.
" IT'S ALREADY ON ITS WAY,"
YOUR MAJESTY.
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?
 THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
TRACK HER DOWN IN THE DESERT
BEFORE THE QUEEN GETS TO HER.
 YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'LL BE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO CAPTURE HER AGAIN?
SHE'LL BE LONG GONE
BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVE.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE THROUGH CHASING HER.
IT'S TIME TO MAKE HER
COME TO US.
 WHAT IS THIS RIFFRAFF DOING
IN MY THRONE ROOM UNANNOUNCED?
" APOLOGIES, YOUR MAJESTY,"
BUT I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING
THAT THE AVATAR WON'T BE
JOINING US TODAY.
 THE AVATAR IS STILL
IN MY CUSTODY.
"HOWEVER, EAVESDROPPING"
ON ROYAL CONVERSATIONS
WILL LAND YOU IN A CELL
RIGHT NEXT TO THOSE BOYS
YOU BROUGHT IN.
"NOW, IF YOU VALUE YOUR FREEDOM,"
YOU'LL TELL ME WHERE
THE AIRBENDERS ARE RIGHT NOW.
 THAT WASN'T THE DEAL.
 I WILL NOT BANDY WORDS
WITH BOUNTY HUNTERS.
SEIZE THESE HOODLUMS
AND THROW THEM IN PRISON
UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO SHOW
PROPER RESPECT FOR THE CROWN!
 OOF! -OOF!
 GUN!
GET BACK HERE
AND LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE
"FOR YOUR QUEEN, YOU COWARD!"
YOU WOULDN'T DARE
ATTACK A QUEEN!
 MAYBE I FORGOT TO MENTION
SOMETHING TO YOU.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN QUEENS.
 YOU THINK FREEDOM IS
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GIVE
"OR TAKE ON A WHIM,"
"BUT TO YOUR PEOPLE,"
FREEDOM IS JUST
AS ESSENTIAL AS AIR.
"AND WITHOUT IT,"
THERE IS NO LIFE.
THERE IS ONLY...
DARKNESS.
" HEY, YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE."
 NO NEED FOR ALARM.
I JUST NEED TO MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE ENTIRE CITY.
HOW DO I DO THAT?
 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
 HE'S THE MAN WHO JUST
TOOK DOWN THE EARTH QUEEN.
YOU WANNA BE NEXT?
" MING-HUA, PLEASE."
WE'RE HERE TO HELP CITIZENS
"LIKE HIM, NOT HURT THEM."
"NOW, CAN YOU HELP ME?"
" ATTENTION,"
CITIZENS OF BA SING SE.
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
"MOMENTS AGO, THE EARTH QUEEN"
WAS BROUGHT DOWN
AT THE HANDS
"OF REVOLUTIONARIES, INCLUDING MYSELF."
I'M NOT GOING
"TO TELL YOU MY NAME,"
'CAUSE MY IDENTITY'S
NOT IMPORTANT.
I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.
I THINK YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
LEADERS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO FIND YOUR OWN PATH.
NO LONGER WILL YOU
BE OPPRESSED BY TYRANTS.
"FROM NOW ON, YOU ARE FREE."
I DELIVER BA SING SE
BACK INTO THE HANDS
OF THE PEOPLE.
" WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE,"
BOLIN.
ZAHEER CAME HERE
"TO TAKE OUT THE EARTH QUEEN,"
AND NOW KORRA IS NEXT.
 YOU KNOW THAT GUY?
HE'S MY HERO!
 SHUT UP!
YOU HAVE TO METALBEND US
OUT OF HERE.
"COME ON, I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT!"
THIS IS YOUR TIME!
 YOU SAID BEFORE WAS MY TIME.
" I KNOW I DID,"
BUT NOW IT'S REALLY YOUR TIME.
DO IT!
 DID YOU SEE THAT? I DID IT!
"I MEAN, NOT FOR US,"
BUT I METALBENT
ALL THE OTHER CELLS OPEN!
 I DON'T THINK THAT WAS YOU.
 LISTEN TO ME.
"I'M GOING TO SET YOU FREE,"
BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FIRST.
I HAVE A MESSAGE THAT
I NEED YOU TO TAKE TO KORRA.
" SHE AIN'T PRETTY,"
BUT I THINK SHE'LL DO THE JOB.
 NO TIME FOR A TEST RUN.
LET'S MOVE!
 I THINK HE'S GONE. WE DID IT!
 YOU WANT TO BUY
A SLIGHTLY USED SAND-SAILER?
" THANKS, ASAMI. YOU'VE GOT"
A GOOD HEAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
 I'M SORRY FOR GETTING US
STRANDED OUT THERE.
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.
" YOU KNOW,"
WHATEVER THE CONFLICT
"BETWEEN YOU AND THE QUEEN IS,"
I'M SURE
IT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE.
YOU GOT A TOUGH JOB.
"GOOD LUCK, AVATAR."
" CAPTAIN, HAVE WE BEEN"
"IN THE DESERT TOO LONG,"
OR IS THAT REALLY
A DRAGON OVER THERE?
 UGH. LET'S GO GET A DRINK.
 AH!
"EASY, GIRL."
DID YOU THINK WE WEREN'T
COMING BACK FOR YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING HERE?
" KORRA, YOU'RE SAFE."
" YEAH, WE MADE IT"
"OUT OF THE DESERT,"
THANKS TO ASAMI.
 DO YOU REMEMBER LORD ZUKO?
 I MET YOU WHEN YOU WERE
A VERY YOUNG GIRL.
"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,"
AVATAR KORRA.
" IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,"
LORD ZUKO.
 THANKS FOR DITCHING ME
BACK AT ZAOFU.
" YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT."
BUT HOW DID YOU ALL FIND US?
" I AM A DETECTIVE, YOU KNOW."
 DID YOU FIND MAKO AND BOLIN?
 SOME PEOPLE
AT THE INN SAW THEM
GET CAPTURED BY ZAHEER'S CREW.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
 DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE EARTH QUEEN?
 WHAT ABOUT HER?
" ONCE AGAIN,"
THE EARTH QUEEN'S REIGN
HAS COME TO AN ABRUPT
AND VIOLENT END.
BA SING SE HAS DESCENDED
INTO CHAOS.
RIOTERS AND LOOTERS
HAVE OVERRUN THE PALACE.
 THE RED LOTUS.
 WHAT'S THAT?
 THE NAME OF THE GROUP
THAT'S BEEN TRYING TO CAPTURE ME
AND JUST TOOK OUT
THE EARTH QUEEN.
I'M AFRAID THIS IS ONLY
"THE BEGINNING, DAD."
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 BA SING SE HAS FALLEN!
AFTER ZAHEER AND THE RED LOTUS
"TOPPLED THE EARTH QUEEN,"
THE CITY DESCENDED INTO CHAOS.
"MEANWHILE, KORRA AND ASAMI"
TRIED TO ESCAPE THEIR CAPTORS
BUT CRASHED IN THE DESERT.
"AFTER GETTING TO SAFETY, THEY MET UP"
"WITH LORD ZUKO, TONRAQ, AND BEIFONG."
"BACK IN BA SING SE,"
"ZAHEER FREED MAKO AND BOLIN,"
GIVING THEM A VITAL MESSAGE
TO DELIVER TO KORRA.
BUT WILL THE BROTHERS
FIND HER IN TIME?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THE UPPER RING IS IN CHAOS.
DON'T TRY TO STOP US.
WE'RE TAKING BACK WHAT'S OURS.
 STOP YOU? I'M GONNA JOIN YOU.
I KNOW WHERE THE GOOD STUFF IS.
 SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING?
 THIS ISN'T OUR BATTLE.
WE HAVE TO DELIVER ZAHEER'S MESSAGE
TO KORRA IMMEDIATELY.
RIGHT. OKAY.
"FIND KORRA, DELIVER MESSAGE."
"YEAH, THIS SHOULD BE EASY."
WE JUST GOTTA GET OUT OF THE CITY
"AND GET TO THE DESERT,"
THEN SOMEHOW FIND HER
"IN THE VAST, EXPANSIVE WASTELAND"
THAT GOES ON FOR THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS OF MILES.
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.
 WE NEED AN AIRSHIP.
 OOH!
"EXCUSE ME,"
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?
"I'M WITH THE REPUBLIC CITY POLICE,"
AND I NEED TO COMMANDEER THIS AIRSHIP
TO HELP THE AVATAR.
 LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.
"HEY, THE QUEEN'S GOLD"
IS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE PALACE!
SECOND DOOR ON THE RIGHT!
YOU JUST GOTTA KNOW
"HOW TO TALK TO THEM, BRO."
 THEY TOOK EVERYTHING.
"I MEAN, WHO RIPS OUT"
A TRANSMISSION RADIO?
 SOME FOLKS JUST DO NOT HAVE RESPECT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY.
NOW LET'S STEAL THIS AIRSHIP!
 YOU KNOW HOW TO FLY THIS THING?
 TECHNICALLY SPEAKING? NO.
"BUT, COME ON, HOW HARD CAN IT BE?"
 UP! UP!
"I DON'T SEE ANY ""UP"" BUTTON."
I SEE LEVERS AND SWITCHES.
"OH, THERE IT IS."
 THE WHOLE CITY IS FALLING TO PIECES.
" MAKO, OUR FAMILY'S DOWN THERE."
 MOVE OVER.
 AHH!
 WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT.
"OH, YOU THINK"
"JUST BECAUSE YOU DATED ASAMI,"
YOU KNOW HOW TO
FLY THIS BETTER THAN ME?
 YEAH.
 BOLIN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 I CAME TO GET YOU GUYS OUT.
THIS WHOLE BLOCK
IS ABOUT TO GO UP IN FLAMES.
"COME ON, MAKO AND I HAVE"
AN AIRSHIP ON THE ROOF.
 WE CAN'T. GRANDMA WON'T GO.
THIS PLACE IS MY WHOLE WORLD.
I WILL NOT LEAVE.
"OH, BUT I'M SO GLAD"
MY LITTLE BOLIN HAS COME BACK TO VISIT.
SIT DOWN. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?
" GRANDMA, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR TEA."
" MOM, PLEASE."
 NO!
I CAN'T ABANDON THE PLACE
WHERE I RAISED MY FAMILY.
IT'S MY HOME.
"GRANDMA, THERE'S ONE THING"
THAT MAKO AND I HAVE LEARNED
FROM ALL OUR YEARS ON THE STREET:
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GO.
"IF YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY WITH YOU,"
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE AT HOME.
 I'M NOT GOING.
 FINE! YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
WE'RE ROLLING OUT!
WAIT.
"OKAY, LET'S GO."
 THANKS FOR GETTING US OUT OF THERE.
"I MEAN, I PROBABLY COULD HAVE"
HANDLED IT MYSELF
"IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T SHOW UP,"
BUT THANKS.
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.
THIS AIRSHIP IS NICE. IS IT OUR NEW HOME?
"NO, GRANDMA, I'M NOT SURE"
WHERE WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU.
"BUT RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO FIND KORRA."
 DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THE AVATAR?
 I'M AFRAID SO.
HER AIRSHIP WENT DOWN
SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT.
SHE WAS COMING FROM A MILITARY BASE
NEAR THE MISTY PALMS OASIS
AND HEADING TO BA SING SE.
IF WE RETRACE HER ROUTE
"BACK TO THE BASE,"
WE SHOULD FIND THE WRECKAGE.
" GUYS, IT'S THE WRECKAGE."
I FOUND IT.
THERE.
THAT'S A BA SING SE
"AIRSHIP, ALL RIGHT."
BUT WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?
"I DON'T KNOW,"
BUT THERE ARE SOME TRACKS.
SEE? I TOLD YOU. LANDING IS HARD.
SPIRITS.
" OKAY, GUYS,"
WE THINK KORRA
FOUND HER WAY BACK HERE.
NOW LET'S SPLIT OFF INTO TEAMS
AND SCOUR THE TOWN.
"YES, WE'LL NEED YOUR HELP TOO, PABU."
NOW JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
WHILE I...
WAIT. PABU?
PABU!
 WHY IS BOLIN HUGGING THAT BIG RAT?
EW. NOW HE'S KISSING IT.
" MWAH, MWAH, MWAH, MWAH."
I'M NEVER GONNA LET YOU GO AGAIN.
"GUYS, LOOK OUT!"
GIANT DOG-BEAST THINGY!
"OKAY, ALL RIGHT, NAGA."
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
"AHH, STOP. YOU'RE LICKING MY MOUTH."
 ASAMI! KORRA!
 YOU GUYS ARE OKAY!
"SORRY, I WAS JUST..."
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S REALLY GOOD
"TO SEE YOU TOO, BOTH OF YOU."
 GOOD. YOU GUYS AREN'T DEAD.
" DON'T GET ALL MUSHY ON ME, CHIEF."
"TONRAQ, SIR."
" OH, MY GOSH. IT'S LORD ZUKO."
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
" UH, FORGIVE MY BROTHER."
WE'RE JUST REALLY HONORED
"TO MEET YOU, SIR."
 IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU AS WELL.
 YOU MUST BE THE AVATAR.
MAKO TOLD ME SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.
YOU ARE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I IMAGINED.
"UH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S ASAMI."
THIS IS AVATAR KORRA.
"KORRA, THIS IS MY GRANDMA, YIN."
 YOU ARE VERY MUSCULAR FOR A WOMAN.
" UM, THANKS. YOU TOO?"
 WHAT LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN.
"MAKO, WHY AREN'T YOU"
DATING ANY NICE GIRLS LIKE THEM?
" UH, SO WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU TWO?"
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WE WERE CAPTURED BY ZAHEER
AND TAKEN TO BA SING SE.
WE WERE THERE WHEN
THE EARTH QUEEN WAS OVERTHROWN.
 WHAT? HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?
 ZAHEER LET US GO.
 WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
BECAUSE HE WANTED US TO FIND YOU
AND DELIVER A MESSAGE.
ZAHEER IS HEADED TO
THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE AS WE SPEAK.
HE SAID HE'S GONNA WIPE OUT
THE NEW AIR NATION
"AND EVERYONE IN IT, UNLESS YOU"
TURN YOURSELF OVER TO HIM.
"ZAHEER'S THREATENING INNOCENT LIVES,"
JUST TO GET TO ME.
 HE COULD BE BLUFFING.
HE'S ALREADY TAKEN OUT
THE EARTH QUEEN.
I DON'T THINK HE BLUFFS.
WE NEED TO RADIO TENZIN
AND WARN HIM THAT
THE RED LOTUS IS COMING.
" I AGREE. UNFORTUNATELY,"
WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO ON THE AIRSHIP.
THERE'S A PORTABLE RADIO
"IN THE JEEP,"
BUT THE SIGNAL WILL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
WE NEED TO GET TO A PLACE
THAT HAS A STRONG RADIO TRANSMITTER.
THE METAL CLAN WILL HAVE ONE.
 LET'S GO. WE'LL RADIO SU ON THE WAY.
HOPEFULLY SHE CAN
GET AHOLD OF TENZIN AT THE AIR TEMPLE
BY THE TIME WE GET TO ZAOFU.
DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK
GETTING THROUGH TO TENZIN?
NO ONE'S ANSWERING.
WHAT IF ZAHEER IS ALREADY UP THERE?
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LET OPAL GO.
" IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, SU."
 I HOPE SO.
"WE HAVE A STRONG SIGNAL,"
BUT NO ONE'S ANSWERING.
I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND HERE
WHILE A MADMAN
IS ON HIS WAY
TO THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
 I'LL READY MY AIRSHIP.
WITH THE FULL FORCE
OF THE METAL CLAN SECURITY
"BACKING US, WE CAN TAKE THEM."
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT UP THERE
BEFORE ZAHEER.
THERE MIGHT BE
ANOTHER WAY TO STOP HIM.
"IT'S A LONG SHOT,"
BUT ZAHEER IS ALWAYS
"MEDITATING INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD,"
XAI BAU'S GROVE.
"IF I COULD FIND HIM THERE,"
MAYBE I COULD SOMEHOW TRAP HIM.
WE CAN'T PROTECT YOU IN THERE.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
 I'LL BE FINE. I HAVE TO TRY.
 I'LL WATCH OVER HER AS SHE MEDITATES.
"I GUESS IN THE MEANTIME,"
MAKO AND I WILL STAY HERE
AND TRY TO GET THROUGH TO THE TEMPLE.
 WE'LL HELP SU READY THE AIRSHIP.
 I'M GOING TO TAKE A NAP.
" ZAHEER, COME OUT! FACE ME!"
LEAVE THE AIRBENDERS OUT OF THIS.
THERE YOU ARE.
" PLEASE DON'T HURT ME, KORRA."
I'M JUST AN OLD MAN.
 IROH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS JUST OUT SEARCHING
FOR A NEW TEAPOT
"TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION,"
BUT INSTEAD I FOUND YOU.
"IN THE SPIRIT WORLD,"
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO FIND SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
YOU LOOK TROUBLED.
 I AM.
 SIT.
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND?
" THERE'S A MANIAC ON THE LOOSE,"
AND HE'S THREATENING
TO DESTROY THE NEW AIR NATION.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE THE AVATAR
DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL
HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.
I KNOW MANY AVATARS
"HAVE NEEDED GUIDANCE,"
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE SINCE AVATAR WAN
THAT CAN'T GET HELP
FROM MY PAST LIVES.
I WISH I COULD TALK TO AANG.
"YOU KNOW, ZUKO AND AANG"
WERE CLOSE FRIENDS.
" LORD ZUKO, OF COURSE."
" YES, MY NEPHEW."
THEIR RELATIONSHIP STARTED OFF
"A LITTLE ROCKY,"
BUT THEY GREW
TO BECOME LIFELONG FRIENDS.
BEST FRIENDS.
 THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE SPIRIT WORLD.
I CAME HERE LOOKING
"FOR SOMEONE ELSE,"
BUT I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU.
 DID YOU FIND ZAHEER?
" NO, HE WASN'T THERE."
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE I NEED TO TALK TO.
YOU'RE LEAVING?
AREN'T YOU COMING
TO THE AIR TEMPLE WITH US?
" I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T."
I'M GOING BACK TO THE FIRE NATION.
IF IT'S TRUE THAT
THE RED LOTUS IS TARGETING
"THE NATION'S LEADERS,"
I NEED TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER.
"I UNDERSTAND,"
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE FIRE LORD SAFE.
"BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE,"
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH SOMETHING.
"I WAS OFTEN AANG'S COUNCIL,"
AND I'D LOVE TO BE YOURS.
"THAT'S JUST IT,"
YOU KNEW AANG BETTER THAN ANYONE.
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW
WHAT HE MIGHT DO
IF HE WERE IN MY SITUATION.
"HMM, REBUILDING THE AIR NATION"
WAS AANG'S BIGGEST DREAM.
HE WOULD BE BESIDE HIMSELF
"WITH JOY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE,"
"AND IF HE ACCOMPLISHED THAT GOAL,"
HE MIGHT HAVE SACRIFICED
ANYTHING TO PROTECT IT.
SO HE WOULD GIVE HIMSELF UP
TO SAVE THE AIR NATION?
 I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.
THE AIRBENDERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
"CLOSEST TO AANG'S HEART,"
"BUT AS THE AVATAR, HE WAS CONCERNED"
WITH PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS.
NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN AANG
THAT IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
THE WORLD NEEDS ITS AVATAR THE MOST.
 THANKS. YOUR UNCLE WAS RIGHT.
IT WAS HELPFUL TALKING TO YOU.
" WAIT, YOU SPOKE WITH MY UNCLE?"
" YES, IN THE SPIRIT WORLD."
A COUPLE OF TIMES ACTUALLY.
"GUYS, WE GOT THROUGH"
TO THE AIR TEMPLE.
 WHO IS THIS?
" I TOLD YOU, IT'S BOLIN!"
"BOLIN'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW,"
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?
"NO, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR BOLIN,"
I AM BOLIN!
"AHH, LOOK, I NEED YOU TO FIND YOUR DAD."
 HE'S OUTSIDE WITH THE BISON.
DID YOU KNOW WE FOUND
A WHOLE HERD FULL OF BABY BISON?
" NO. A WHOLE HERD, REALLY?"
"MEELO, THIS IS"
YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER.
"GO GET YOUR DAD, NOW."
" YES, SIR."
 COME ON. COME ON.
" HELLO, THIS IS TENZIN."
" TENZIN, LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY."
ZAHEER IS ON HIS WAY TO THE TEMPLE.
HE'S COMING FOR THE AIRBENDERS.
YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYONE
OUT OF THERE IMMEDIATELY.
DROP EVERYTHING. LEAVE NOW!
" OH, NO."
 WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
"TENZIN! TENZIN, WHAT'S HAPPENING?"
 IT'S TOO LATE.
HE'S HERE.
" WHAT IS IT, DADDY?"
WE NEED TO GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.
STAY CLOSE TO ME.
" WHAT'S GOING ON, TENZIN?"
 IT'S ZAHEER. ROUND EVERYONE UP.
WE NEED TO GET TO THE BISON
AND EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.
" GUYS, WE GOT AN EMERGENCY."
WE'RE EVACUATING THE TEMPLE. COME ON.
LOOK OUT!
 IT'S ZAHEER. WE HAVE TO LEAVE.
"NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE,"
OR SHE GETS IT.
" GOOD, THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS HERE."
IT'S A PLEASURE TO FINALLY MEET
A TRUE AIRBENDING MASTER.
 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT FROM US?
 NOTHING AT ALL.
"IN FACT, IF EVERYONE COOPERATES,"
YOU WILL ALL WALK OUT
OF THIS SITUATION UNHARMED.
 THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
"I WANT KORRA,"
AND I'M TIRED OF CHASING HER.
 YOU'RE USING US AS LEVERAGE?
 YES.
 I WILL NEVER LET YOU GET TO KORRA.
"UNFORTUNATELY,"
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
" YES, I DO."
"JINORA, GET EVERYONE OUT OF HERE."
"BUMI, KYA, HELP ME HOLD THEM OFF."
AND STAY OUT OF HER LINE OF SIGHT.
GO. GO!
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS...
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE STABLES WITH HER UP THERE.
 NO.
 OOF!
I SEE YOU'RE HAVING
AS MUCH FUN AS I AM.
 I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
" WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
 WHATEVER I CAN.
GET TO THE BISON! GET OUT OF HERE!
 KAI! NO.
I GOT YOU.
" BUMI, LET GO."
 BUT WE COULD DIE.
 WE'RE GONNA DIE IF WE HANG ON.
 OOF.
 GIVE UP. IT'S OVER.
"AS LONG AS I'M BREATHING,"
IT'S NOT OVER.
WHOA!
"THANKS, BUDDY. YIP-YIP."
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
 THE NEW AIR NATION IS IN JEOPARDY.
IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE KORRA
"TO SURRENDER HERSELF,"
ZAHEER AMBUSHED
THE NORTHERN AIR TEMPLE.
"TENZIN, BUMI AND KYA ATTEMPTED"
TO HOLD OFF THE RED LOTUS
BUT WERE INJURED IN BATTLE.
THE AIRBENDERS WERE
UNABLE TO ESCAPE
"AND EVERYONE WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE,"
EXCEPT KAI.
NOW KORRA AND TEAM AVATAR
"RACE TO THE TEMPLE,"
HOPING TO MOUNT A RESCUE.
I SAY WE MAKE OUR APPROACH
FROM THE WEST.
DROP DOWN FROM THE AIRSHIP
ON CABLES.
AMBUSH THESE RED LOTUS LOWLIFES
BEFORE THEY KNOW WHAT HIT THEM.
 IT'LL NEVER WORK.
THAT COMBUSTION LADY
WILL PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.
YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA
HOW TO SAVE THE AIRBENDERS?
 YEAH.
"WE COME UP FROM THE VALLEY,"
"SCALE THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,"
AND TAKE THEM OFF GUARD.
 THAT COULD WORK.
 AND GIVE THEM THE HIGH GROUND? NO.
"IF THEIR LAVABENDER SPOTS US,"
HE'LL MELT THE MOUNTAINSIDE
AND US WITH IT.
 WAIT! I GOT IT.
I'LL DISGUISE MYSELF AS A LOST HIKER.
"AND ONCE I'M IN THE TEMPLE,"
I'LL DISTRACT THE RED LOTUS
WITH MY BIRD CALLS.
CAW! CAW!
CAW! CAW!
THAT'S WHEN YOU ALL STRIKE!
 BIRD CALLS? REALLY?
"WELL, I HAVEN'T NOTICED YOU"
OFFERING ANY SUGGESTIONS.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
NONE OF THESE IDEAS WILL WORK.
THE SECOND ZAHEER REALIZES
"WE'RE UP TO SOMETHING,"
HE'LL WIPE OUT THE AIRBENDERS.
 AND OPAL IS ONE OF THOSE AIRBENDERS.
"BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND"
WHAT'S AT STAKE.
 THEN I THINK YOU'LL AGREE.
THE ONLY PLAN THAT WILL WORK
IS FOR ME TO GIVE MYSELF UP.
 WHAT?
" KORRA, NO."
 WE'LL FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY.
" I TALKED IT OVER WITH LORD ZUKO,"
AND I'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT.
I HAVE TO DO THIS.
YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO SIT BY
AND JUST LET ZAHEER TAKE YOU.
THE WORLD HAS BEEN OUT OF BALANCE
FOR FAR TOO LONG.
IT NEEDS THE AIR NATION BACK AGAIN.
I CAN'T LET ZAHEER DESTROY IT
AND EVERYONE WE LOVE.
HELP ME SAVE THE AIRBENDERS.
THEN YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT SAVING ME.
" WE'RE WITH YOU, KORRA."
" YES, WHATEVER YOU NEED."
WE'RE HERE.
 I'LL GO RADIO ZAHEER.
"ZAHEER, ARE YOU THERE?"
IT'S ME.
 I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR CALL.
SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
 YES.
"YOU RELEASE THE AIRBENDERS,"
AND THEN I'LL TURN MYSELF OVER.
AND TAKE AWAY
THE ONLY LEVERAGE I HAVE?
NO.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
LISTEN CAREFULLY.
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.
 WILL YOU SIT DOWN?
I'M ALREADY TENSE ENOUGH AS IT IS!
 I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT OPAL.
AND PABU'S NOT HERE TO COMFORT ME.
I HOPE HE AND NAGA
ARE DOING OKAY BACK IN ZAOFU.
 NO.
NOT MAKO'S SCARF!
BAD DOG AND RAT-THINGY!
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU TWO.
 DID YOU SPEAK TO ZAHEER?
 YES.
HE TOLD ME TO COME TO THE TOP OF
LAGHIMA'S PEAK AT NOON. ALONE.
"ONCE HE HAS ME, HE'LL RELEASE THE"
AIRBENDERS OVER TO YOU AT THE TEMPLE.
I THINK I FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO PLAY THIS
SO THE AIRBENDERS AND KORRA
ALL COME OUT IN ONE PIECE.
 HOW?
ZAHEER DOESN'T KNOW
HOW MANY OF US THERE ARE.
SO WE HAVE THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.
I SAY WE SPLIT INTO TWO TEAMS.
"MAKO, BOLIN AND ASAMI"
WILL TAKE THE AIRSHIP UP TO THE TEMPLE.
"MEANWHILE, MY METALBENDERS,"
"TONRAQ, LIN, AND I WILL GET"
INTO POSITION BELOW LAGHIMA'S PEAK.
 LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.
ENTER THE VOID.
EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.
 THE AIRBENDERS ARE SECURE.
" THANK YOU, P'LI."
FOR EVERYTHING.
 OF COURSE.
" I WANT YOU TO KNOW,"
NOT ONE DAY WENT BY IN THAT PRISON
WHEN I DIDN'T THINK OF YOU.
THE YEARS APART ONLY MADE
MY LOVE FOR YOU STRONGER.
"AND, DEEP DOWN, I KNEW"
YOU'D FIND A WAY TO GET ME OUT.
JUST LIKE YOU SAVED ME FROM BECOMING
THAT WARLORD'S KILLING MACHINE
WHEN I WAS A GIRL.
YOU'VE SHOWN ME
WHAT TRUE FREEDOM MEANS.
" AND, AFTER TODAY,"
WE'LL SHOW THE ENTIRE WORLD
WHAT IT MEANS.
NO MORE PRISONS.
NO MORE RUNNING.
" I LOVE YOU, ZAHEER."
 I LOVE YOU TOO.
RADIO THE SECOND
YOU SEE THOSE AIRBENDERS.
" I WILL, CHIEF."
GOOD LUCK.
" BE CAREFUL, KORRA."
 YOU TOO.
 KORRA.
" DON'T WORRY, DAD."
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.
THE RISK YOU'RE TAKING
TO SAVE THE AIR NATION
WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR GENERATIONS.
" I LOVE YOU, DAD."
" I LOVE YOU TOO, SWEETHEART."
" AND, DAD."
WATCH OUT FOR ZAHEER.
HE'S NOT VERY FOND OF WORLD LEADERS.
 I CAN HANDLE HIM.
JUST STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR MISSION.
" OH, MAN."
MUST HAVE BEEN SOME FIGHT.
"MAKO, DO YOU SEE THE AIRBENDERS?"
 NOT YET.
WE'RE JUST ARRIVING.
DON'T TURN YOURSELF OVER
UNTIL I GET A VISUAL ON THEM.
 THIS WAY.
YOU WANT THE AIRBENDERS OR NOT?
DROP YOUR STAFF
AND SURRENDER YOURSELF.
DON'T MAKE ME COME GET YOU.
MAKO. WHAT'S GOING ON?
 THEY'RE HERE.
BUT SO IS THE LAVABENDER.
TELL GHAZAN
TO LET THE AIRBENDERS GO.
 NOT UNTIL YOU TURN YOURSELF OVER.
THIS ISN'T A NEGOTIATION.
WIPE THEM OUT.
 NO! WAIT!
I'M COMING.
 STAND DOWN.
AND DON'T BOTHER TRYING
TO METALBEND OUT OF THESE.
THEY'RE PLATINUM.
 WE HAVE HER.
" IT'S OKAY, TENZIN."
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
" KORRA, IT WAS A TRICK!"
THEY'RE NOT HERE!
DON'T TURN YOURSELF OVER!
 WE HAD A DEAL!
" CHIEF, GET KORRA OUT OF THERE NOW!"
 GO! GO!
GET THE AVATAR ON THE AIRSHIP.
I'LL DEAL WITH THEM.
" NOWHERE TO GO, ZAHEER!"
 WHERE ARE THE AIRBENDERS?
 I DON'T KNOW.
ZAHEER MOVED THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE.
 WILL YOU JUST BURY THEM ALREADY?
 COME ON.
WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE AIRSHIP!
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!
THE EXIT'S BLOCKED!
 WHERE'S OOGI?
 GONE.
ALL THE BISON GOT SCARED OFF
DURING THE ATTACK.
BUT I THINK I KNOW ANOTHER WAY OUT.
"BOLIN, CAN YOU GET US"
THROUGH THAT WALL?
 ON IT!
 THROUGH THERE.
IS IT JUST ME?
"OR IS IT, UH, GETTING"
REALLY WARM IN HERE?
"OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD."
"LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE!"
SAY HELLO TO THE EARTH QUEEN FOR ME.
 DAD!
 WE'RE PINNED DOWN!
 I'M GONNA DRAW HER FIRE.
YOU TAKE HER OUT.
" LIN, NO."
 I LOVE YOU.
"COME AND GET ME,"
YOU THIRD-EYED FREAK!
OOH!
 P'LI!
" IT'S OVER, ZAHEER."
 LET GO YOUR EARTHLY TETHER.
 RELEASE THE AVATAR!
 ENTER THE VOID.
 THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!
 EMPTY AND BECOME WIND.
 NO! STOP!
 DID HE JUST FLY?
 GUESS HE DOESN'T NEED A RIDE.
 KORRA.
 WE CAN'T OUTRUN IT!
THIS WAY!
 NOW WHAT?
 BOLIN!
YAH!
 INCREDIBLE.
 YOU'RE A LAVABENDER.
 I KNOW.
I JUST FOUND OUT.
" HEY, YOU GUYS NEED A LIFT?"
 KAI.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
 MORE OR LESS.
EVERYONE HOP ON.
 I OWE YOU MY LIFE.
"THANK YOU, CAPTAIN."
 YOU CAN CALL ME KUVIRA.
 CAW! CAW!
CAW! CAW!
" HEY, EVERYBODY."
THERE'S SOMETHING I GOTTA TELL YOU.
HOW DID YOU GUYS
MAKE IT OUT OF THAT TEMPLE ALIVE?
 IT WAS ALL BOLIN.
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE FOR.
"THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, HE LAVABENDS."
I KNEW YOU HAD THE POTENTIAL
FOR SOMETHING BIG.
YOU JUST HAD TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
BEING MOMENTS FROM DEATH
WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOTIVATOR TOO.
"OF COURSE, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE"
MADE IT BACK WITHOUT KAI.
 GLAD I COULD HELP. SO ANYWAY...
 DID ZAHEER GET AWAY WITH KORRA?
 I'M AFRAID SO.
" APPARENTLY, HE CAN FLY NOW."
 WHAT?
 HOW?
 ARE YOU SURE?
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT
EITHER IF I HADN'T SEEN IT FOR MYSELF.
I'VE HEARD THE LEGENDS ABOUT
GURU LAGHIMA'S ABILITY TO FLY.
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED THEY WERE TRUE.
 SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?
 I HAVE AN IDEA.
" NOT RIGHT NOW, KID!"
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
ZAHEER TOOK KORRA.
 AND FIND THE AIRBENDERS.
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU!
"I KNOW WHERE THE AIRBENDERS ARE,"
AND I BET IT'S WHERE KORRA IS TOO!
" WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?"
WHERE ARE THEY?
HOW DID YOU FIND THEM?
" AFTER I GOT BLASTED OUT OF THE SKY,"
"I WOKE UP ON THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,"
WHERE THIS LITTLE FELLOW FOUND ME.
I TRIED TO SNEAK BACK INTO THE TEMPLE
"TO SEE IF I COULD RESCUE EVERYONE,"
AND THAT'S WHEN
I SAW THE AIRSHIP LEAVING.
I FOLLOWED IT TO SOME CAVES
A FEW MILES FROM HERE.
THAT GIANT LADY
MET UP WITH SOME PEOPLE
WHO TOOK THE AIRBENDERS
INTO THE CAVES.
 WAS IT GHAZAN AND MING-HUA?
" NO, THERE WERE FOUR MORE OF THEM."
DIDN'T LOOK FAMILIAR.
MUST BE MORE RED LOTUS
MEMBERS THAN WE THOUGHT.
 I COULDN'T FIGHT THEM ALL ON MY OWN.
"SO I CAME BACK HERE,"
HOPING YOU GUYS WOULD SHOW UP.
 WE NEED TO GET TO THOSE CAVES.
HOW? I DON'T THINK
WE CAN ALL FIT ON MY BISON.
 OOGI!
"I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO, OLD FRIEND."
 I WANNA COME WITH YOU.
" NO, KUVIRA. STAY WITH THE INJURED."
WE'LL BE BACK FOR YOU
ONCE WE HAVE THE AVATAR.
"HEY, UM, I APPRECIATE YOU"
COMING BACK FOR US.
SORRY FOR EVER GIVING YOU A HARD TIME.
 THAT'S OKAY.
I PROBABLY DESERVED IT.
" YEAH, YOU KINDA DID."
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL US
YOU CAN FLY?
 I WASN'T SURE I COULD.
ONLY ONE OTHER AIRBENDER
IN HISTORY HAD THE ABILITY.
 HOW'D YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT?
 I FOUND TRUE FREEDOM.
I AM NO LONGER BOUND TO THIS EARTH
BY WORLDLY DESIRES.
I HAVE ENTERED THE VOID.
 WHERE'S P'LI?
SHE SACRIFICED HER LIFE
FOR OUR CAUSE.
NOW LET'S MAKE SURE IT WASN'T IN VAIN.
YOU...
YOU KILLED MY FATHER.
 I UNDERSTAND YOUR GRIEF.
I ALSO LOST SOMEONE I LOVED TODAY.
BUT YOUR PAIN WILL SOON BE OVER.
BRING THE POISON.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
THE RED LOTUS HAS CAPTURED
THE AVATAR.
KORRA GAVE HERSELF UP IN
"EXCHANGE FOR THE AIRBENDERS,"
"BUT ZAHEER DOUBLE-CROSSED HER,"
WHILE GHAZAN TRAPPED
TEAM AVATAR IN THE TEMPLE.
ALL SEEMED LOST
UNTIL BOLIN SAVED THEIR LIVES
BY LAVABENDING.
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH NEW SKILLS...
ZAHEER UNLOCKED THE ANCIENT
AIRBENDING ABILITY OF FLIGHT.
WILL TEAM AVATAR SAVE THE AIR NATION
AND KORRA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE?
"WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,"
NONE OF YOU WILL SURVIVE!
 YOU WON'T GET OUT.
UNLESS THE METAL CLAN TAUGHT
YOU A WAY TO BEND PLATINUM.
"ONCE WE ADMINISTER THIS POISON,"
"YOUR BODY WILL NATURALLY REACT,"
FORCING YOU
INTO THE AVATAR STATE
IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.
"SADLY FOR YOU,"
YOU'LL BE ENTERING IT
FOR THE LAST TIME.
 NO.
THE AVATAR CYCLE...
 YES.
WHEN WE DISPATCH YOU
"IN THE AVATAR STATE,"
THE CYCLE WILL END.
"SO WE LUCKY FEW,"
THIS BAND OF BROTHERS
"AND SISTERS IN ANARCHY,"
ARE WITNESSING THE BEGINNING
OF AN ERA OF TRUE FREEDOM.
TOGETHER WE WILL FORGE A WORLD
"WITHOUT KINGS AND QUEENS,"
"WITHOUT BORDERS OR NATIONS,"
WHERE A MAN'S ONLY ALLEGIANCE
IS TO HIMSELF
AND THOSE HE LOVES.
WE WILL RETURN TO THE TRUE
BALANCE OF NATURAL ORDER.
AND THOUGH YOU
"WILL NEVER AGAIN BE REBORN,"
YOUR NAME WILL ECHO
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.
"KORRA, THE LAST AVATAR."
DID YOU FIND ANY WAY TO ESCAPE?
" NO, NOT YET."
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND A WAY OUT SOON.
THEY MIGHT NOT
MAKE IT THAT LONG.
"KORRA WILL COME TO SAVE US,"
RIGHT?
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO THIS ON OUR OWN.
 ADMINISTER THE POISON.
AH. AHH!
 GET READY.
AS SOON AS SHE'S IN THE AVATAR
"STATE, TAKE HER OUT."
 WAIT.
WHY ISN'T SHE STAYING
IN THE AVATAR STATE?
 GIVE IT TIME.
SHE CAN'T RESIST FOR LONG.
THE PLACE WHERE I SAW THEM
TAKING THE AIRBENDERS
IS AROUND HERE.
THAT'S GOTTA BE WHERE
THEY TOOK KORRA.
 THAT'S IT!
"DOWN THERE, LEFTY."
FIND THE AIRBENDERS
AND MY FAMILY.
 DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT COMING OUT
WITHOUT OUR CHILDREN
AND THE REST OF YOUR PEOPLE.
 IT'S WORKING.
" I TOLD YOU, KORRA."
THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED YOU
ANYMORE.
THE TIME OF THE AVATAR
"IS OVER, KORRA."
GIVE UP.
YOU'RE TOO WEAK TO RESIST
AND I'M STRONGER THAN EVER.
THERE'S NO USE FIGHTING.
LET GO.
LET GO.
LET GO.
 I'M THIRSTY.
 I GOTTA GO PEE.
 ME TOO.
HEY. KEEP IT DOWN OVER THERE
OR YOU'RE ALL GOING
TO END UP LIKE THEM.
"SIR, PLEASE."
COULD WE JUST HAVE SOME WATER?
THERE ARE CHILDREN
AND A BABY HERE.
 AH!
"OH, SO YOU JUST CALLED"
ME OVER TO ATTACK ME.
FINE. NOW NOBODY GETS ANY WATER.
AH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE ENDED
UP HERE IN DAY CARE
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE GETS TO
WATCH THE AVATAR BEING DESTROYED.
I CAN HOLD A BOWL OF POISON.
 HEY!
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
 AH!
 MOM!
"OH, HONEY,"
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.
OH!
 ME TOO.
YOU'RE ALIVE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
 WHY?
JUST BECAUSE I WAS BLOWN
OUT OF THE SKY
AND FELL HUNDREDS OF FEET
DOWN A CLIFF?
DON'T YOU KNOW IT TAKES MORE
THAN THAT TO GET RID OF ME?
WE HAVE TO GET THESE TWO
OUT OF HERE NOW.
THEY DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I FEEL GREAT.
YOU GUYS GET EVERYONE
OUT OF HERE.
I'LL SEARCH FOR KORRA.
 WE'RE GOING WITH YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH
FOR HER.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
SHE'S BEING HELD.
 NOW!
DESTROY THE AVATAR.
UGH.
AH!
 KORRA.
WE HAVE TO HELP HER!
 LOOK OUT!
YOU HELP KORRA. WE GOT THIS.
DADDY!
"OH, THANK GOODNESS"
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
" HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?"
 I'LL BE FINE.
 WE HAVE TO HELP KORRA.
AH!
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
THE LAST TIME WE FOUGHT.
"WELL, A LOT HAS CHANGED"
SINCE THEN.
SO THAT'S HOW
YOU GOT OUT OF THE TEMPLE.
NOT BAD.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
YOU CAN'T FIGHT ME
AND THE POISON.
I CAN FLY UP ON MY BISON
TO HELP HER.
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP WITH ZAHEER.
HE'S TOO POWERFUL.
 WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
 HOW CAN HE FLY LIKE THAT?
HE'S UNLOCKED POWERS
OF AIRBENDING
THAT HAVEN'T EXISTED
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN
THIS MANY AIRBENDERS
IN ONE PLACE
"FOR A LONG TIME, EITHER."
WE HAVE POWER TOGETHER.
HURRY! EVERYONE FORM A CIRCLE.
FOLLOW ME.
AH!
 YOU HAVE NO WATER.
IT'S OVER.
 NOT YET.
NOW IT'S OVER!
 AH!
"GIVE UP GHAZAN, YOU CAN'T WIN!"
I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO PRISON.
"IF I'M GOING DOWN TODAY,"
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
" MAKO, HANG ON."
AH!
AH!
THE POISON HAS DONE ITS WORK.
THE AVATAR CYCLE
WILL BE OVER MOMENTARILY.
AH!
 AH.
" KORRA, SWEETHEART,"
"IT'S ME, DAD."
PLEASE HANG ON.
 WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT?
 YOU'RE TOO LATE!
THE POISON'S BEEN
IN HER SYSTEM TOO LONG.
THE RED LOTUS HAS WON.
YOU CAN SAVE HER.
THE POISON IS METALLIC.
DAD? YOU'RE ALIVE.
 I'M HERE FOR YOU.
I'M NEVER GOING TO LET YOU GO.
 NO!
NO!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE REVOLUTION
HAS ALREADY BEGUN.
CHAOS IS THE NATURAL ORDER OF...
YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
I PUT A SOCK IN IT.
LITERALLY.
 CLASSIC BOLIN.
 I DO WHAT I DO.
 THERE YOU GO.
ALL FIXED UP FOR A FORMAL
AVATAR APPEARANCE.
TAKE A LOOK.
 IT'S GREAT.
THANKS.
"YOU KNOW, NOBODY EXPECTS YOU"
TO BOUNCE BACK RIGHT AWAY.
IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO WEEKS.
YOU NEED TIME TO HEAL.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M HERE FOR YOU.
"IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK,"
OR ANYTHING.
BUT LET'S JUST TRY
TO ENJOY THIS TODAY.
FOR JINORA.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
OKAY.
LET'S GO.
" YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, SWEETIE."
YOU'RE LOOKING STRONGER
"EVERY DAY, KORRA."
I'D LIKE TO OFFICIALLY
WELCOME YOU BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY.
I KNOW THAT THE LAST TIME
WE SAW EACH OTHER
"IT DIDN'T END ON THE BEST TERMS,"
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR TAKING DOWN
THOSE RED LOTUS TERRORISTS.
 WE SHOULD GO INSIDE.
 I CAN HELP.
 I WANNA RIDE WITH KORRA.
JINORA'S ALREADY INSIDE.
IT SMELLS LIKE SHOE TREES.
" SANDALWOOD, MEELO."
 I GOT THIS.
"HANG IN THERE, KID."
 SHE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.
NEITHER WOULD YOU IF YOU'D
GONE THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD.
 SHE'LL BE FINE.
SHE JUST NEEDS TIME TO HEAL.
THE POISON TOOK A GREAT TOLL.
 OF COURSE.
"I'M JUST SAYING,"
WITH THE EARTH KINGDOM
IN COMPLETE DISARRAY
SINCE THE LOSS OF THE QUEEN...
AND EVEN WITH ZAHEER
"LOCKED UP AGAIN,"
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY RED LOTUS MEMBERS
"MIGHT BE OUT THERE, HIDING."
 EXACTLY.
WITH THE WORLD GETTING MORE
"AND MORE DANGEROUS,"
WE NEED THE AVATAR
NOW MORE THAN EVER.
WHO WILL PROTECT US
WHILE SHE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR?
" JINORA, COME FORWARD."
TODAY WE WELCOME THE FIRST
"AIRBENDING MASTER IN A GENERATION,"
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD
OF MY DAUGHTER.
WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF
"OUR PEOPLE WAS THREATENED,"
WHEN THE AVATAR'S LIFE
"HUNG IN THE BALANCE,"
JINORA NEVER GAVE UP HOPE.
"THANKS TO HER LEADERSHIP, I SEE A VERY"
BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE AIR NATION.
"OF COURSE, THERE WOULD BE NO AIR"
NATION WITHOUT AVATAR KORRA.
SHE OPENED THE PORTALS AND SOMEHOW
THE WORLD BEGAN ANEW FOR US.
AND SHE WAS EVEN WILLING
TO LAY DOWN HER OWN LIFE
IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURS.
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN EVER
REPAY HER FOR ALL SHE'S DONE.
BUT WE CAN FOLLOW HER EXAMPLE
OF SERVICE AND SACRIFICE.
"SO WHILE SHE RECUPERATES,"
THE AIR NATION WILL RECLAIM ITS
NOMADIC ROOTS AND ROAM THE EARTH.
"BUT UNLIKE OUR ANCESTORS,"
WE WILL SERVE PEOPLE
"OF ALL NATIONS,"
WORKING WHEREVER THERE IS
"CORRUPTION AND DISCORD,"
TO RESTORE BALANCE AND PEACE.
"AVATAR KORRA,"
I VOW THAT WE WILL DO
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER
TO FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS
AND BRING HARMONY TO THE WORLD.
"NOW, LET US ANOINT THE MASTER"
WHO WILL HELP LEAD US
IN OUR NEW PATH.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
" WELCOME TO REPUBLIC CITY,"
"THE PLACE OF HOPES,"
"DREAMS, AND SPIRIT WILDS."
THIS METROPOLIS TRULY
HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.
"VISIT AIR TEMPLE ISLAND,"
THE HUB FOR ALL AIR BENDERS
AS THEY TRAVEL THE WORLD
HELPING OTHERS.
OR TAKE A STROLL THROUGH
"BEAUTIFUL AVATAR KORRA PARK,"
NAMED IN HONOR OF YOU-KNOW-WHO.
WE'VE MISSED HER
THESE PAST THREE YEARS
AND WE CAN'T WAIT
TO WELCOME HER HOME.
"GET WELL SOON, KORRA."
AND OF COURSE YOU'LL WANT TO SEE
"OUR MOST UNIQUE ATTRACTIONS,"
THE SPIRIT WILDS.
HERE SPIRITS AND PEOPLE LIVE
"HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER,"
LIKE THIS OLD CODGER
AND HIS NEW PALS.
"YES SIRREE, THIS TOWN IS"
TRULY ON THE UP AND UP.
COME BE A PART OF THE ACTION
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
"AND OF COURSE, MY BIGGEST"
THANKS GOES TO ASAMI SATO
AND FUTURE INDUSTRIES.
SHE BROUGHT OUR OLD CENTRAL
TERMINAL INTO THE MODERN ERA.
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,"
THE WORLD IS ENTERING A NEW AGE
OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY.
"SOON, PRINCE WU WILL TAKE HIS"
RIGHTFUL PLACE
"ON THE EARTH KINGDOM THRONE,"
AND THANKS
"TO OUR UPDATED RAIL SYSTEM,"
REPUBLIC CITY
AND THE EARTH KINGDOM
WILL BE
UNITED LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
" HEY THERE, ASAMI RIGHT?"
GREAT TRAIN HOUSE.
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME
"A PERSONAL TOUR SOMETIME,"
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I DO LIKE THE IDEA
OF PUTTING YOU ON A TRAIN
"AND SENDING YOU FAR, FAR AWAY."
THAT'S... THAT'S FUNNY.
I LIKE FUNNY DAMES.
"MAYBE I SHOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF,"
"I'M PRINCE WU, FUTURE KING."
YEAH... I'M AWARE
OF WHO YOU ARE.
DON'T LET MY REPUTATION
INTIMIDATE YOU.
I'M STILL HUMAN
"JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,"
"ONLY MORE HUMAN, LIKE EXTRA-HUMAN,"
"OR, HMM, SUPER-HUMAN."
 SUPER-HUMAN?
" SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?"
CAN I SHOW YOU A LOW-KEY
NIGHT OUT
WITH A SUPER-HUMAN
SOON TO BE KING?
"PRINCE WU, PRESIDENT RAIKO"
HAS SOME REALLY IMPORTANT
KING STUFF TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
NOW? FINE.
"THINK OVER THE OFFER,"
I'LL BE BACK.
" HE'S A REAL CHARMER, HUH?"
 HE'S... SOMETHING.
HOW CAN YOU STAND
BEING HIS BODYGUARD?
"WELL, I JUST REMIND MYSELF"
"THAT ONCE HE'S ON THE THRONE,"
I GO BACK TO BEING A DETECTIVE.
 AND THAT WORKS?
 I ALSO GO HOME
AND SMASH MY HEAD
INTO THE WALL FOR AN HOUR.
"YOU KNOW, JUST TO"
GET THE STRESS OUT.
"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAKO."
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
YOU HEAR FROM BOLIN LATELY?
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
"FOR A WHILE,"
BUT HE'S COMING IN A FEW
DAYS FOR THE CORONATION.
AND BEIFONG TOLD ME THAT
KORRA IS GETTING IN TONIGHT.
 I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER.
IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD HAVING
THE OLD TEAM AVATAR
BACK IN THE CITY
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
AFTER YOUR CORONATION
THE UNITED FORCES
WILL ESCORT YOU TO BA SING SE.
" RIGHT, ABOUT THAT."
ARE WE ALL POSITIVE
THAT THE EARTH KINGDOM
IS SAFE ENOUGH FOR ME TO RETURN?
I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND
EVERYONE WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY GREAT AUNT
THREE YEARS AGO?
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.
"PRINCE WU, I ASSURE YOU"
KUVIRA HAS THE EARTH KINGDOM
PRETTY MUCH
STABILIZED AT THIS POINT.
" DEFINE ""PRETTY MUCH."""
"WELL, THE ROVING BANDITS"
HAVE MOSTLY BEEN DISPERSED.
 MOSTLY?
 DON'T WORRY KID.
THE CHANCES OF YOU BEING
ASSASSINATED ARE ALMOST ZERO.
 ALMOST?
 GET OUT OF HERE.
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT.
"NOW, YOU DON'T"
HAVE ANYTHING LEFT.
"IT'S SAFE TO COME OUT EVERYONE,"
THE AIRBENDERS ARE HERE.
 YOU FINALLY MADE IT.
"SO, WHERE ARE THE REST OF YOU?"
"ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST"
"THE TWO OF US,"
BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP.
"I'M OPAL, AND THIS IS KAI"
 IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
 WHAT?
I CALLED MASTER TENZIN
BECAUSE MY STATE HAS BEEN
UNDER SIEGE BY BANDITS
FOR MONTHS.
"THEY BLOCKED ALL THE ROADS,"
"CUT OFF OUR SUPPLY LINES,"
AND ALL HE SENT IS YOU TWO KIDS?
"HEY, US TWO KIDS JUST TOOK CARE OF"
THOSE THREE GUYS FOR YOU.
THERE ARE HUNDREDS
MORE WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
MY CITIZENS ARE GOING HUNGRY.
OUR ENTIRE STATE
IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE.
"UNFORTUNATELY, THE AIR NATION IS"
SPREAD THIN RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE ALL YOU HAVE.
 WE JUST GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.
TWO MORE EARTH KINGDOM STATES
HAVE AGREED TO JOIN US.
"EXCELLENT. THANK YOU, BOLIN."
"WE'RE 90% THERE, KUVIRA."
THAT'S GREAT!
"ZHU LI, DISH OUT SOME OF THAT"
SPECIAL CELEBRATION TEA.
 NONE FOR ME.
I WON'T CELEBRATE UNTIL
THE EARTH KINGDOM IS 100% REUNITED.
 WHY HAVE WE STOPPED?
"APOLOGIES,"
THERE ARE ROCKS ON THE TRACKS.
IT'S MOST LIKELY BANDITS.
WE'RE SENDING TROOPS
TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.
 CALL THEM OFF.
I WILL TAKE CARE OF
THE BANDITS MYSELF.
 GAH!
 O-WAH!
 AAH!
 OWW!
 AHH!
 ARGH!
" UGH, OOH!"
 EHH!
" ACK, OHH!"
 YOU'RE... KUVIRA.
AND YOU'RE THE BANDITS
WHO HAVE BEEN CAUSING CHAOS
WHERE I AM TRYING TO ESTABLISH
"ORDER, AREN'T YOU?"
WE'RE SORRY. WE DIDN'T KNOW
THIS WAS YOUR TRAIN...
 DON'T TALK OVER ME.
" PLEASE, TAKE MERCY ON US."
STOP GROVELING AS IF THIS
IS THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
THIS IS A GOOD DAY.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ALL
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO REHABILITATE YOURSELVES
AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE
MEMBERS OF YOUR NATION.
"RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE LOST,"
"BUT PLEDGE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME,"
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A NEW PURPOSE IN YOUR LIVES.
"OF COURSE,"
"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO JOIN,"
YOU COULD ALWAYS STAY
RIGHT HERE.
HOPEFULLY SOMEONE SAVES YOU
BEFORE THE NEXT TRAIN
"SPEEDS THROUGH,"
BUT I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.
"NO, WE'LL JOIN."
DON'T LEAVE US HERE.
WE PLEDGE OUR LOYALTY
"TO YOU, GREAT UNITER."
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE
LEAVING SO EARLY
IF YOU'RE JUST GETTING
A HAIRCUT.
THE DINNER AT AIR TEMPLE ISLAND ISN'T
UNTIL LATER TONIGHT.
BECAUSE I'M NOT
JUST GETTING A HAIRCUT.
IT'S A SPA DAY.
WE'RE TALKING
MINIMUM FOUR HOURS.
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING DONE
THAT TAKES FOUR HOURS?
A REJUVENATING
TEA LEAF SKIN WRAP.
HAVE YOU EVER
"GOTTEN ONE OF THOSE, MAKO?"
"YEAH, I'M NOT INTERESTED."
" OH, YOU WILL BE."
SO WHILE YOUR HANDS SOAK
"IN A BUBBLING MILK BATH,"
YOUR FEET ARE IN A TUB FULL
OF THESE LITTLE SUCKERFISH
THAT LITERALLY EAT
YOUR CALLUSES AWAY.
GOBBLE THEM RIGHT UP.
"CRAZY, HUH?"
 THAT'S DISGUSTING.
THEN THEY SCRAPE YOUR SKIN
"WITH BLOCKS OF SEA SALT,"
LUBE YOU UP WITH
"SEAWEED INFUSED ALOE,"
"WRAP YOU IN TEA LEAVES,"
PUT YOU IN A HOT BOX
"FOR FOUR HOURS AND BAM,"
YOU'RE DONE!
"MAKO, LOOK AT ALL MY FANS."
THEY MUST BE IN TOWN
FOR MY CORONATION.
"UH, I DON'T KNOW IF ALL"
THOSE PEOPLE ARE YOUR FANS.
BOO!
 YEAH!
"ALL RIGHT, WU!"
"WU, WE HAVE TO GET YOU"
OUT OF HERE.
 WHAT?
" GO, GO."
WHAT JUST HAPPENED OUT THERE?
I THINK THOSE WERE KUVIRA
SUPPORTERS IN THE CROWD.
"OH, NO! MAKO, I'VE BEEN HIT."
IT'S A GUSHER.
"THAT'S NOT BLOOD,"
IT'S STRAWBERRY PIE.
 HMM.
"OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT."
BUT THAT WAS CLOSE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD'VE
HAPPENED IF YOU WEREN'T THERE.
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN HIT BY A PIE.
IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.
 OR I COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D EVER
DO WITHOUT YOU.
"WAIT A SECOND,"
DID YOU SAY STRAWBERRY PIE?
I'M ALLERGIC TO STRAWBERRIES.
I DON'T THINK I CAN BREATHE.
"GET ME TO THE HOSPITAL, WU DOWN."
YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO BEE STINGS.
" OH, RIGHT."
I ALWAYS GET THOSE TWO MIXED UP.
LOOK! A TRAIN MADE IT THROUGH.
MAYBE THEY BROUGHT
FOOD AND SUPPLIES.
"HEY, WHAT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND"
DOING HERE?
"IF HE'S HERE, HE MUST BE"
WITH KUVIRA AND MY BROTHER.
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE GOOD.
 BOLIN!
 KAI!
"WOW, YOU ARE A LOT HEAVIER"
"THAN YOU USED TO BE,"
YOU'RE REALLY GROWING UP.
WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR NEW HAIR?
YOU LOOK LIKE A STIFF.
"HEY, KUVIRA SAYS IT MAKES ME"
LOOK INTELLIGENT AND PROFESSIONAL.
DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
SHE SAYS.
"OPAL, I CAN'T BELIEVE"
YOU'RE HERE TOO.
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
" I MISSED YOU, TOO."
 LOOK WHO IT IS.
"IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,"
LITTLE SISTER.
 WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.
A HAPPY REUNION
FOR MY FAVORITE COUPLE.
 HOW'S MOM DOING?
LIKE YOU CARE.
SHE STILL HASN'T FORGIVEN YOU.
"YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE WHO"
"CLAIMS TO BE SO ENLIGHTENED,"
MOM CAN REALLY HOLD A GRUDGE.
I GUESS WHEN HER SON
BETRAYS HER...
 PLEASE.
OPAL. WE'RE NOT HERE
TO BICKER WITH YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
THREE YEARS AGO.
"WE'RE HERE TO HELP THIS TOWN,"
JUST LIKE YOU.
I'VE HEARD HOW YOU HELP
TOWNS... BY CONQUERING THEM.
I KNOW THE RUMORS ABOUT ME
"CAN BE PRETTY NASTY,"
BUT I AM GIVING EVERYONE IN
"THIS NATION A BETTER FUTURE,"
AND WITH BOLIN'S HELP
"AND MY FIANCE'S IDEAS,"
WE'RE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
FOR THE PEOPLE
TO ACHIEVE THEIR OWN GREATNESS.
 YOUR FIANCE?
 YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?
YOUR BROTHER
AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED.
"ISN'T THAT GREAT, SWEETIE?"
I KNOW THINGS GOT HEATED
WITH YOUR FAMILY
"WHEN BAATAR AND I LEFT ZAOFU,"
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO FORGIVE AND FORGET?
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
"HELLO, GOVERNOR. I WAS WONDERING IF"
YOU AND I COULD TALK PRIVATELY.
"SO, HAVE YOU HAD TIME"
TO RETHINK MY GENEROUS OFFER?
GENEROUS?
YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYTHING.
HOW IS THAT GENEROUS?
"GOVERNOR, YOUR STATE"
HAS BEEN OVERRUN BY BANDITS.
THEY HAVE YOU OUTNUMBERED
AND OUT-SUPPLIED.
THE QUESTION'S NOT IF
"THEY'LL TAKE OVER, IT'S WHEN."
UNLESS YOU SIGN OUR DEAL.
AGREE TO OUR TERMS
AND YOU'LL HAVE THE
FULL FORCE OF MY ARMY BACKING YOU.
"YOU WILL REMAIN IN CHARGE,"
JUST UNDER MY SUPERVISION.
"I WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE,"
AND THE LIVES OF YOUR CITIZENS.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GENEROUS.
I KNOW HOW YOU MANIPULATE STATES
AND FORCE THEM
TO JOIN UP UNDER YOU.
I KNOW THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANT THIS REGION
IS BECAUSE IT'S RICH IN ORE.
THEY MIGHT CALL YOU
"""THE GREAT UNITER,"""
BUT YOU'RE DESTROYING
EVERYTHING.
I'LL NEVER TURN
THE GREAT STATE OF YI
OVER TO YOU.
" YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE,"
BUT IT CANNOT PROTECT
YOUR PEOPLE.
YOUR PRIDE WILL NOT STOP
THE HORDES
AS YOUR CITY CRUMBLES
"TO THE GROUND,"
AND YOUR PRIDE CERTAINLY
WILL NOT FEED YOUR HUNGRY
WHEN ALL THAT IS LEFT IS RUBBLE.
LEAVE! GET OUT OF MY STATE.
" YOU WILL PERISH,"
UNLESS
YOU TAKE MY GENEROUS OFFER.
"IT'S TIME TO GO,"
WE'RE NOT WANTED HERE.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
IT APPEARS WE CAN'T
MAKE A DEAL RIGHT NOW.
" WAIT,"
AREN'T YOU GUYS GONNA
STICK AROUND AND HELP?
" HERE'S THE CONTRACT,"
WE'LL WAIT AT THE BORDER
FOR ONE DAY.
"YOU GET THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN IT,"
AND YOU'LL HAVE
ALL THE HELP YOU NEED.
 I GUESS I GOTTA GO.
" DON'T, PLEASE!"
YOU CAN'T TURN YOUR BACK
ON THESE PEOPLE.
"I'M NOT. I WANT TO HELP, BUT IF"
"THE GOVERNOR WANTS US GONE,"
THERE'S... THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.
I'M SORRY... HEY!
"OPAL, PLEASE."
LEAVE IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
"YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT NOT"
NEED THEIR HELP AFTER ALL.
"THE ROADS MAY BE IMPASSABLE,"
BUT NOT THE SKIES.
WE CAN USE LEFTY TO FLY
"TO ALL THE NEARBY VILLAGES,"
PICK UP SUPPLIES AND FLY BACK.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE CAN SAVE THIS TOWN OURSELVES.
"SORRY WE COULDN'T GIVE YOU MORE,"
THAT'S ALL WE COULD SPARE.
 EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS.
BECAUSE OF YOU AND
"THE OTHER FARMERS AROUND HERE,"
WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOOD
TO FEED THE TOWN
UNTIL WE CAN GET SOME
REINFORCEMENTS.
 THANKS.
SO... YOU AND BOLIN DOING OKAY?
 I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S REALLY TOUGH HAVING
"A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP,"
AND I CAN'T STAND
THAT HE'S WORKING WITH KUVIRA.
 I CAN TELL.
BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE HE FOUND
"HIS CALLING, DOESN'T IT?"
HE LOVES HELPING PEOPLE.
"MAYBE, IT'S JUST..."
HE'S CHANGED A LOT
SINCE HE'S BEEN AROUND HER.
 HE'S GROWING UP.
I JUST HOPE
WE'RE NOT GROWING APART.
SPEAKING OF
"LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS,"
HOW ARE YOU AND JINORA DOING?
" ACTUALLY, WE'RE DOING FINE."
YOU HEAR THAT?
IT'S MORE BANDITS.
WE'RE HOOKED.
 NO!
AH!
WHOA!
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S ALL THE FOOD?
WE WERE ATTACKED IN MID-AIR.
WE LOST EVERYTHING.
IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO MAKE A TOUGH CALL.
"HERE, TELL KUVIRA"
TO SAVE MY PEOPLE.
"FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I THINK"
YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
DID I EVER REALLY HAVE A CHOICE?
"WHEN KORRA GETS HERE,"
I BET SHE'S NOT EVEN
GONNA KNOW WHO I AM.
 WHY IS THAT?
 BECAUSE MEELO THE BOY
HAS TURNED INTO MEELO THE MAN.
"RIGHT, YOU'RE"
COMPLETELY UNRECOGNIZABLE.
YOU'VE NEVER
HAD THE TEA LEAF WRAP?
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.
THE FACE MASSAGE ALONE
IS TO DIE FOR.
UGH. THIS CORONATION
CANNOT SOME SOON ENOUGH.
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK
TO BEING A DETECTIVE.
"RIGHT. UM, YEAH, ABOUT THAT."
 WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS.
YOU'RE GOING TO BA SING SE
WITH THE PRINCE.
 NO!
"I TRIED TO GET YOU OUT OF IT,"
BUT IT'S OVER MY HEAD.
WU PERSONALLY ASKED RAIKO.
HE SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
 THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
I'M NOT EVEN AN EARTH KINGDOM
CITIZEN.
I WORK FOR THE REPUBLIC CITY
POLICE DEPARTMENT.
NOT ANYMORE. YOU'RE JUST A PAWN
IN RAIKO'S DIPLOMATIC GAME.
"YOU CAN TRY TALKING TO HIM,"
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S GOING TO LET YOU QUIT.
THERE'S A SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE SHIP
PULLING UP TO THE DOCK.
 KORRA!
 COOL!
 YEAH!
THE STATE OF YI IS NOW UNDER
THE FULL PROTECTION OF MY ARMY.
"PROCLAIM YOUR LOYALTY,"
IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR POST.
"I PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO YOU,"
GREAT UNITER.
"TONRAQ, IT'S GOOD"
"TO HAVE YOU BACK IN THE CITY,"
AND EVERYONE IS EXCITED
TO SEE THE AVATAR AGAIN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ISN'T KORRA ALREADY HERE?
"NO, WE THOUGHT"
SHE WAS COMING WITH YOU.
KORRA LEFT THE SOUTH POLE
SIX MONTHS AGO.
SHE'S WRITTEN ME LETTERS.
SHE SAID SHE WAS HERE
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
"I ASSURE YOU,"
YOUR DAUGHTER'S NOT HERE.
 THEN WHERE IS SHE?
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
UNH!
UNH.
WE HAVE A WINNER.
"HERE,"
FOR YOUR LACKLUSTER PARTICIPATION.
 THANKS.
"YOU KNOW,"
YOU LOOK VERY FAMILIAR.
"YEAH, YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE"
THAT AVATAR GIRL.
 I GET THAT A LOT.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HER ANYWAY?
 I WOULDN'T KNOW.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
THE AVATAR HAS GONE MISSING!
"THREE YEARS AGO,"
"ZAHEER POISONED KORRA,"
SEVERELY INJURING HER.
WHILE HER FRIENDS MOVED ON
"WITH THEIR LIVES,"
KORRA REMAINED
IN THE SOUTH POLE.
EVERYONE THOUGHT
"SHE WAS STILL RECUPERATING,"
"BUT SIX MONTHS AGO, KORRA LEFT HOME"
AND HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE.
EVEN CHIEF TONRAQ
WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN
THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S
WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN.
WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE AVATAR
AND WHEN WILL SHE RETURN?
HURRY UP IN THERE!
"COME ON, I GOT"
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION!
 KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.
HUH?
YOU AGAIN.
LEAVE ME ALONE!
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
"YOUNG LADY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"
CAN I TAKE YOU TO A DOCTOR?
" NO, I DON'T NEED ANY HELP."
NOW DON'T TAKE THIS
"THE WRONG WAY,"
BUT I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.
HOW ELSE IS SHE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THAT BUT THE WRONG WAY?
I MEAN BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
HAD A PEN PAL BEFORE.
I'M GOING TO WRITE YOU
"SO MANY LETTERS,"
AND JUST TO GET
"THE BALL ROLLING,"
HERE. SPOILER ALERT.
PABU AND I ALREADY MISS YOU.
" THANKS, THAT'S SWEET."
 ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
SOME COMPANY IN
THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE?
 I'M HAPPY TO COME WITH YOU.
" NO, I APPRECIATE IT,"
BUT I'LL ONLY BE GONE
A COUPLE WEEKS.
A LITTLE TIME ALONE
WILL BE GOOD FOR ME.
NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY
ABOUT A THING WHILE YOU'RE GONE.
YOUR RECOVERY SHOULD BE
YOUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN.
"JINORA, THE AIRBENDERS AND I"
HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.
" BYE, KORRA!"
 GET BETTER SOON!
 DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!
AH!
 CAN'T SLEEP AGAIN?
"HONEY, YOUR FATHER AND I"
HAVE TRIED TO GIVE YOU
AS MUCH SPACE AS YOU'VE
"NEEDED, BUT WE'RE WORRIED."
YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING.
YOU'RE BARELY EATING.
"WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH YOU,"
BUT IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS.
WILL YOU PLEASE GO SEE KATARA?
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO.
YOU'RE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS.
"OH, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH."
THE POISON DID A LOT
OF INTERNAL DAMAGE.
 CAN YOU FIX IT?
I CAN HELP GUIDE
"YOUR HEALING PROCESS,"
BUT WHETHER YOU GET BETTER
OR NOT IS UP TO YOU.
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO THROUGH
"A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE,"
"AND I PROMISE YOU,"
IF YOU DEDICATE YOURSELF
"TO GETTING BETTER,"
YOU'LL RECOVER
STRONGER THAN EVER.
"THAT'S WHAT I WANT,"
MORE THAN ANYTHING.
 THEN TRY SOMETHING FOR ME.
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BIG TOE.
VISUALIZE IT MOVING.
BREATHE.
DID YOU SEE THAT?
IT WORKED!
THE MIND CAN BE A POWERFUL ALLY
OR YOUR GREATEST ENEMY.
"NOW, I WANT YOU TO TRY"
TAKING A STEP.
AH!
UGH!
 YOU'RE OKAY.
YOUR BODY THINKS
"IT'S STILL IN DANGER,"
BUT YOU'RE SAFE HERE.
USE YOUR MIND
TO OVERCOME THE PAIN.
 TRY AGAIN.
 I'M DONE FOR TODAY.
"""DEAR KORRA, I MISS YOU."
"""IT'S NOT THE SAME"
IN REPUBLIC CITY WITHOUT YOU.
"""HOW ARE YOU FEELING?"
THINGS ARE GOING WELL HERE.
"""I JUST GOT A BIG CONTRACT"
"""TO HELP REDESIGN"
"THE CITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE,"
SO I'LL BE KEEPING
"PRETTY BUSY FOR AWHILE."""
" ""HEY, KORRA."
"""SO, I'M NOT VERY GOOD"
AT WRITING LETTERS.
15 IN THE AFTERNOON.
WEATHER IS FAIR.
"""CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS"
LATER TODAY.
"""BUT ENOUGH JOKING AROUND."
I HOPE YOU'RE DOING WELL.
"""ME? I'M BACK ON THE BEAT."
"""BEIFONG HAS ME STAKING OUT"
"THE RED MONSOON HIDEOUT,"
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
"WHAT'S GOING DOWN."""
"""MY DEAREST, AVATAR KORRA."
"""THOUGH SEVERAL FORTNIGHTS"
"HAVE PASSED SINCE YOUR DEPARTURE,"
"""TO CONVALESCE IN THE HOMELAND"
"OF YOUR TRIBESMEN,"
"""I FEEL OUR FRIENDSHIP KNOWS"
NEITHER TIME NOR DISTANCE.
"""YOU WILL BE"
MOST PLEASED TO LEARN
"""THAT I FOUND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT"
"""WITH SIR VARRICK"
AND THE LADY KUVIRA.
"""I SET OFF ON THE MORROW"
"WITH SOME TREPIDATION,"
"""BUT I AM EAGER TO OFFER"
ANY AID I CAN
IN STABILIZING
"THE EARTH KINGDOM."""
 WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
 WHAT'S THE POINT?
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR ALMOST SIX MONTHS
AND I CAN BARELY TAKE A COUPLE
OF STEPS WITHOUT COLLAPSING.
"I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED, BUT..."
OF COURSE I'M FRUSTRATED!
"A CRAZY MAN POISONED ME,"
AND NOW I CAN'T DRESS MYSELF
OR COOK FOR MYSELF
"OR DO ANYTHING FOR MYSELF,"
AND THIS WHOLE TIME
MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN OFF
HELPING THE WORLD
"WHILE I'M STUCK WITH YOU,"
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN HEAL ME!
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
 IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET YOUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION
FLOW LIKE WATER.
I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY THIS HAPPENED TO ME.
BUT NOTHING MAKES ANY SENSE.
"I'M TIRED, KATARA. I'M SO TIRED."
"KORRA, I KNOW YOU FEEL"
"ALONE RIGHT NOW,"
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST AVATAR
WHO'S HAD TO OVERCOME
GREAT SUFFERING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH PAIN
AANG FELT WHEN HE LEARNED
THAT HIS ENTIRE CULTURE
WAS TAKEN FROM HIM?
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN SO AWFUL.
BUT HE NEVER LET IT
DESTROY HIS SPIRIT.
HE CHOSE TO FIND MEANING
"IN HIS SUFFERING,"
AND EVENTUALLY FOUND PEACE.
AND WHAT AM I GONNA FIND
IF I GET THROUGH THIS?
"I DON'T KNOW, BUT WON'T IT"
BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT?
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
VISUALIZE YOURSELF
WALKING OVER TO NAGA.
 CAN YOU SEE IT?
 YES.
" NOW, TAKE THAT FIRST STEP."
"WHERE'D YOU COME FROM,"
LITTLE CUTIE?
" YOU CAN SEE HER, TOO?"
"IF YOU CAN SEE HER, TOO,"
MAYBE I'M NOT GOING CRAZY.
 HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
 YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW YOU?
"ALL RIGHT,"
LET'S SEE WHAT I FIND.
 IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
"HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, KORRA."
YOU LOOK GREAT.
I FEEL GREAT. COME ON.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
HOW MUCH BETTER I'M DOING.
ATTACK! I CAN TAKE IT.
 AH! AH!
"ALL RIGHT,"
THE SPARRING MATCH IS OVER.
 I THOUGHT I WAS READY.
THERE IS NO SHAME
IN TAKING THE TIME YOU NEED
TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.
BEING THE AVATAR CAN WAIT.
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE EARTH KINGDOM?
I HEAR IT'S STILL
A MESS OUT THERE.
THE SITUATION
HAS BEEN STABILIZING
SINCE KUVIRA TOOK CHARGE.
BUT THAT SHOULD BE ME OUT
"THERE FIXING THINGS, NOT HER."
"I KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP,"
"BUT TRUST ME,"
EVERYONE HAS THIS UNDER CONTROL.
I JUST THINK YOU NEED TO...
" IF YOU SAY, ""BE PATIENT,"""
I SWEAR I'M GONNA
WATER-SMACK YOU IN THE MOUTH.
"NO, I WAS GOING"
TO SAY YOU NEED TO...
NOT WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE.
BE GRATEFUL
FOR WHERE YOU ARE NOW
AND THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE.
"""DEAR ASAMI, I'M SORRY"
"I HAVEN'T WRITTEN TO YOU SOONER,"
"""BUT EVERY TIME I'VE TRIED,"
I NEVER KNEW WHAT TO SAY.
"""THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN"
THE HARDEST OF MY LIFE.
"""EVEN THOUGH I CAN"
"GET AROUND FINE NOW,"
"""I STILL CAN'T GO INTO"
THE AVATAR STATE.
"""I KEEP HAVING VISIONS OF ZAHEER"
AND WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.
"""KATARA THINKS A LOT OF THIS"
"IS IN MY HEAD,"
"""SO I'VE BEEN MEDITATING A LOT,"
"""BUT SOMETIMES I WORRY"
I'LL NEVER FULLY RECOVER.
"""PLEASE DON'T TELL"
MAKO AND BOLIN
"""I WROTE TO YOU AND NOT THEM."
"""I DON'T WANT"
"TO HURT THEIR FEELINGS,"
"""BUT IT'S EASIER TO TELL YOU"
ABOUT THIS STUFF.
"""I DON'T THINK"
"THEY'D UNDERSTAND."""
"EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE?"
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU BOTH.
 WHAT IS IT?
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO REPUBLIC CITY.
 ARE YOU SURE?
" I KNOW I'M NOT 100% YET,"
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE HIT A WALL.
"I NEED TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS,"
WHERE MY FRIENDS ARE.
I'LL HAVE THE WHITE LOTUS
PREPARE A BOAT
AND THEY CAN TAKE YOU BACK TO
REPUBLIC CITY AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY.
" NO, I WANT TO GO ALONE."
AND HAVE SOME TIME
TO CLEAR MY HEAD.
IT WILL BE GOOD FOR ME.
" TWO LOBSTER CRABS, PLEASE."
"WHY, YOU'RE THE AVATAR,"
AIN'T YA?
" YEP, THAT'S ME."
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
MIND IF I TAKE A PICTURE
FOR MY WALL OF AVATARS?
 I'M KIND OF IN A HURRY.
 IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.
AVATAR AANG WAS A BIG FAN
"OF MY SEAWEED WRAPS, YOU KNOW,"
"SO I NAMED THEM ""AANG ROLLS."""
NOW THEY'RE MY BIGGEST SELLER.
AND THEY AIN'T EVEN GOT
FISH IN 'EM.
NOW SMILE.
BUT IF COULD HAVE MET
"ANY AVATAR,"
I'D HAVE TO PICK KYOSHI.
TAKING DOWN A SHARK SQUID
WITH ONE HAND?
NOW THAT'S A LADY
I'D LIKE TO GET TO KNOW.
THIEVES! GET BACK HERE!
"OH, DON'T WORRY."
THE AVATAR'S RIGHT HERE.
"WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"
GO GET 'EM!
 HAND OVER THE BAGS OR ELSE.
AH! UGH!
 YOU SURE SHE'S THE AVATAR?
"EVERYONE, COME HERE!"
IT'S THE AVATAR!
 YOU SURE?
I DON'T SENSE
ANY RAAVA ENERGY AROUND HER.
"BESIDES, SHE'S NOT DRESSED"
LIKE THE AVATAR.
DOESN'T THE AVATAR
HAVE PONYTAILS?
DO YOU MIND?
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE HERE.
"AND, YES, I AM THE AVATAR."
I'M JUST WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES
AND I CUT MY HAIR.
SEE? I TOLD YOU GUYS IT WAS HER.
HOW COME YOU'VE BEEN
AWAY SO LONG?
I WAS HURT PRETTY BAD
"A WHILE AGO,"
AND LOST TOUCH
WITH MY AVATAR SPIRIT.
NO WONDER I COULDN'T FEEL
RAAVA'S ENERGY.
I CAME TO THE TREE OF TIME
HOPING TO RECONNECT WITH RAAVA
AND TURN ON
THE AVATAR STATE AGAIN.
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING.
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE
I SAW ALL SORTS OF VISIONS.
NOW I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU
GET BETTER.
"I'M SORRY, BUT FOR YEARS"
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING
THEY CAN HELP ME GET BETTER.
NOTHING'S WORKED.
I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT
ON MY OWN.
"""DEAR MOM AND DAD,"
"""I ARRIVED IN REPUBLIC CITY"
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
"""AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER."
"""IT'S NICE TO BE BACK"
"AT THE TEMPLE,"
"""AND IT'S GREAT"
TO SEE MY FRIENDS AGAIN.
"""DON'T WORRY,"
"I'M TAKING IT EASY,"
"""BUT HOPEFULLY"
I'LL BE BACK IN ACTION SOON.
"""I MISS YOU BOTH VERY MUCH."
"""PLEASE GIVE NAGA"
A BIG HUG FOR ME.
"LOVE, KORRA."""
RAAVA?
RAAVA!
I AM ENDING THIS.
"EXCUSE ME, WHO DO I TALK TO"
ABOUT GETTING IN THE RING?
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
 WE HAVE A WINNER!
 HURRY UP IN THERE!
WHY DID YOU BRING ME
TO THE SWAMP?
"WAIT, I MET YOU"
AT THE TREE OF TIME.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME
WHO YOU WERE.
"IF I DID,"
WOULD YOU HAVE FOLLOWED ME?
 I GET YOUR POINT.
BUT WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE?
WHAT AM I GONNA FIND
IN THE SWAMP?
NOT A WHAT. A WHO.
" NO, WAIT!"
COME BACK!
YOU'RE JUST IN MY MIND.
YOU'RE NOT REAL.
AH! UGH!
AHH!
AH!
HELP!
 FEELING BETTER?
WHERE AM I? WHAT HAPPENED?
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TELL ME.
I FOUND YOU
PASSED OUT IN THE MUD.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS OUT THERE?
I'M PRETTY TAPPED INTO
THE GOINGS-ON AROUND HERE.
WHAT BRINGS YOU
"TO THE SWAMP, ANYWAY?"
 A SPIRIT LED ME HERE
AND TOLD ME I WAS SUPPOSED
TO FIND SOMEONE.
 IS THAT YOU?
 BEATS ME.
BUT IF YOUR AVATAR SENSES
"CALLED YOU HERE,"
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
LISTEN TO THEM.
" WAIT, YOU RECOGNIZE ME?"
 IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS
IN YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
TOPH?
"NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,"
TWINKLETOES.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the avatar can master all four elements...
And bring balance to the world.
 So much has changed these past three years.
"Mako is a bodyguard for the future earth king,"
"Prince Wu, while"
"Bolin works for Kuvira,"
The earth kingdom's interim leader who has
Brought stability to a nation plagued by chaos.
"Meanwhile, after wandering the world trying to heal herself,"
"A spirit led Korra to the swamp, where she met Toph Beifong."
Will this earthbending master be the key
To Korra regaining her avatar mojo?
" So then the crowds are gathered,"
"All excited to see my coronation,"
"When all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through."
And guess what pops out of 'em?
Earthbender dames!
These gals start banging the boulders like drums
And sing the song of my royal lineage.
It's the most dynamite six-hour show you've ever seen
In your life.
 Shouldn't you be getting ready to... I don't know...
Rule the whole nation?
" Now, now, now."
Don't get yourself in a tizzy.
I'll have ministers for all that.
"No sir, Mako."
"When we get to Ba Sing Se,"
It'll just be two kooky pals livin' the life!
 Yay...
 Getting excited for your big day?
 Does a platypus bear poop in... hey!
You can't put bleachers there!
There won't be enough room for the dance of the badgermoles!
"Look, it's gonna go like this."
 You sure that's the guy you want running the earth kingdom?
 Trust me.
We'll be sending a delegation
Of experienced advisors to handle day-to-day governing.
 I see the Prince is becoming accustomed to
The burdens of leadership.
 You know royals.
They love a ceremony.
Have you received any word on the avatar's location?
" Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world"
On the lookout for her.
I hope they find her soon.
I'm concerned about reports I've heard
Regarding Kuvira's growing military.
They say she's throwing some of her dissenters
Into prison camps.
" Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow."
We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that.
 And you're not worried about her
Handing power over to Prince Wu?
" When Kuvira started cleaning up the earth kingdom,"
She knew her position wasn't permanent.
She gave me her word that she'd step down.
" Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here."
 You've gotta help me get back into avatar fighting shape.
I'm getting my butt kicked
By losers all over the earth kingdom.
The world needs me.
 Get over yourself.
The world doesn't need you one bit.
" But while I've been the avatar, I've stopped"
Some really bad people from doing some really bad things.
" Listen, when I was chief of police of republic city,"
I worked my butt off busting criminals.
But did that make crime disappear?
Nope.
If there's one thing
"I learned on the beat,"
"It's that the names change, but the street stays the same."
" So, basically, you're saying that"
Everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.
And I thought
Beifong was grumpy.
 I'm the original Beifong.
" So, you're not gonna train me?"
" Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud"
For a few weeks.
But I can't stand you
Being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time.
All right. I guess I can help.
 Thank you!
 Nah-ah-ah-ah.
"You want to hug something, go hug a tree."
We're here to work.
" Hello, republic city!"
Bolin is back!
And Eska's also here.
 I see you have replaced me with a new girlfriend.
Well done.
She seems very threatening.
" Oh, no, no. That's Kuvira."
She's kind of my boss.
 Boss. Girlfriend. Same thing.
" I'm afraid there's been a mistake, your eminence."
"We have you and your brother booked in the same room,"
With only one bed.
 It's no mistake.
Desna sleeps in the tub.
 Never thought I'd be allowed back in
The republic city four elements.
Raiko must have turned purple
When Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.
" You're an upstanding citizen again, sir."
 Upstanding is right!
And don't forget to
Fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps
As you can grab.
Love the lavender scent.
 Bolin!
Look at you!
My little brother got all...
Important.
" I know, right?"
"I see myself in the mirror sometimes,"
"And I think I'm in trouble before I realize,"
It's only me.
 So... What's it like working for Kuvira?
"From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh."
 No!
"I mean, she can be tough, sure,"
But we're turning around the earth kingdom
Like you wouldn't believe.
You remember how bad grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was?
All that's completely changed.
"I mean, we are really..."
Helping people.
But what have you been up to?
Fighting crime? Busting triads?
"Chasing the ladies, Mako style?"
" Well, I've been working for Wu."
"And, uh... Yeah."
 So have you seen Korra yet?
" No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq,"
But he says she left the south pole months ago.
No one knows where she is.
 Mother.
" Hello, Baatar junior."
" It's just ""Baatar"" now."
"So, now that you've seen all the good we've done"
"Since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that"
You didn't come and help us.
" I don't if I'd call marching all over the earth kingdom,"
"Forcing people to bow to Kuvira,"
"""doing good."""
 You're going to have to get over your grudge with her.
I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged.
She's going to be an official member of our family.
 I'm just glad that she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.
 You prefer to be ruled by that royal idiot?
 I hope I'm not out of order saying this...
You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type.
"I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff,"
Maybe get you a little upgrade.
I've been living here for years.
They love me.
 I won't be needing your help.
We've reserved the presidential suite.
" Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop."
"See, I'm in the presidential suite."
 Not anymore.
I had you moved out.
" Wait, what?"
"Cam, where's all my stuff?"
 We moved you into a very nice junior suite
On the seventh floor.
 Junior suite?
 Something you should know about me...
I always get what I want.
" Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!"
 Where have you been?
My coronation is in ten minutes.
Where's everyone else?
Where are the seven sacred chests of exquisite finery?
Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?
" Sadly, most of your servants were scattered"
And the royal things were looted after the queen was...
Removed from office.
So your coronation may not have some of the usual items...
Like... The crown.
 There's no crown?
How can you have a coronation without a crown?
How will people know when
I'm officially the king?
 We still have one of the royal jewels we can pin on you.
 An earring?
 Think of it more as a royal brooch.
 Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles?
No acrobat bell-ringers?
No horn-blowing announcer-y guy?
" It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony."
A wonderful day for your kingdom.
"Just try on the brooch, your grace."
You'll see it will look beau...
 Don't...
Touch me.
 Okay. Bring it.
 Tell me what you did wrong.
 Well... I was thinking that you were gonna...
 Exactly.
You were thinking.
Go again.
 Pathetic.
"Of all the avatars I've worked with, you're by far the worst."
"I know that's only one other avatar, but still."
 Ah! Hey!
It seems like you're enjoying having someone around
To beat up an awful lot.
" Yeah, the swampbenders out here really can't take a punch."
 So... What made you want to drop out
And disconnect from the rest of the world?
 I'm more connected to the world than you've ever been.
The roots and vines... they run all over the world.
"I can see Su and Lin,"
Zaofu and republic city...
I see everything.
 You're blind compared to me.
" Now rise, Wu of the Hou-ting dynasty,"
"King of all the earth lands,"
And glorious defender of Ba Sing Se.
Long may you reign.
 Go Wu. Woo.
 Thank you for that incredibly brief but very moving ceremony.
I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen
Who have worked so hard
To restore their beloved leader to the throne.
One of them deserves special attention.
Kuvira? Rise.
"For your service to the realm,"
I would like to present you
"With the Kyoshi medal of freedom,"
"Our nation's highest honor,"
"Which was somehow not stolen, unlike the royal pinkie rings."
Hmph.
 Thank you.
"And if you don't mind,"
I'd like to say a few words.
 Why not?
We've got six hours to fill.
" Growing up in Zaofu with Suyin Beifong,"
I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title
"From one generation to the next was archaic,"
And that technology and innovation should be
What drives a nation forward.
It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused
The earth kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray.
"It's taken me three years to get it back on track,"
And there's no way
I will allow it
To slip back into the dark ages.
I'd like to make an announcement to the world.
The earth kingdom is no more.
"And from here on out, this man has no authority."
" Wait, what?"
But I just got the royal brooch.
" I have created a new earth empire,"
"And I will continue to lead it into the future myself,"
Bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people.
" We love you, Kuvira!"
 All hail the great uniter!
 And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing...
Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way
Will be crushed.
" Thank you, Kuvira!"
All hail the great uniter!
 Worst coronation ever.
 Were you surprised?
Because I was really surprised.
Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?
" Relax, kid, what can they do?"
"Kuvira controls the whole nation now,"
And republic city is begging for the metal that we're mining.
"This train has left the station,"
And we own the track!
Now that's a nice-looking hunk of spirit vine.
Let's take it back to the lab
And get it stabilized immediately.
" You look worried, Bolin."
" Yeah, well..."
I just have some misgivings
About how you kind of ambushed
Tenzin and the other leaders.
 You believe in the work that we've done
"For the people of the earth empire, right, Bolin?"
" I do, but..."
 Then stick with me.
I'm going to need your help now more than ever.
Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into
Accepting some idiot king who will serve them
But neglect the people.
We have to stand strong against them.
 I'm just not sure about this whole empire thing.
It seems pretty aggressive.
And what was that part about the crushing?
 That was just some tough rhetoric to let people know
That we mean business.
"Believe me, conflict is the last thing I want."
"Will you help me make history, Bolin?"
 Hmm. I'll stand by you.
 Thank you.
 We need to talk.
" Can you give us the room, please?"
" I met with the world leaders,"
And I've come as their representative.
 So now you're taking an interest in world affairs?
"A little late, isn't it?"
When the queen fell and everyone was asking you
"To help keep the earth kingdom from falling apart,"
All you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu
And let others deal with the consequences.
 That's hardly fair.
I didn't want to seize power
"For myself, which is what you've done."
"I'm telling you, for the good of everyone,"
You have to step down.
 I stepped up.
I provide stability and equality.
Tell your world leaders to stay out of earth empire business.
We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.
 What makes you so different?
You're just another tyrant.
And don't pretend the people put you where you are.
I know what happens to cities who don't want
To hand over control to you.
 Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.
" First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne."
My royal brooch is a lie!
"I know you must be crushed,"
Not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.
 Don't worry about me.
I'll find a way to make it.
" Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy."
"Ugh. Okay, I just have to go on,"
"Move forward, take decisive action."
Let's go shopping!
Ugh. Get rid of him.
He's with her.
 He's my brother.
" Interesting ceremony, huh?"
 You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira
Now that she's going against the wishes
"Of the entire world, are you?"
 You don't understand.
Kuvira is helping out
"All the poor people in the earth empire,"
People like our family.
This is for the best.
" I don't know, bro."
" Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself?"
"We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on"
Some new innovations.
We're making history.
 By crushing anyone who gets in your way?
 That was just some tough rhetoric
To let the people know that we mean business.
"I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra..."
"She might seem hard to deal with,"
But it's just because she's so passionate
And believes in what she's doing.
 It seems like she's just a dictator
Who's taking the earth kingdom by force.
" Oh, okay, so you think your new best friend in there"
Would be a better leader than Kuvira?
" Well, no, but still..."
 still what?
"Come on, Mako, I'm making a difference out there."
"What are you doin', huh?"
You're just some glorified butler
"For some snotty, rich bozo."
 I'm sorry.
I don't want to work for
Your glorious emperor in her military dictatorship.
 Fine!
"I'm gonna go back to my awesome train,"
Where we bring freedom wherever we go.
Enjoy licking the king's boots in your junior suite!
" Sorry, sport. I heard it all."
 Can't believe him!
 I know!
Insulting another man's suite?
It's beneath low.
But I think I know what would cheer you up...
A visit to little Ba Sing Se fashion mall!
I'll buy you a smoothie.
 Yeah. Okay.
 That was terrible.
 Ha! Maybe for you.
I had a great time!
I never realized how much
I missed tormenting the avatar.
I wish you were putting up more of a fight.
But it was still fun.
 You were tossing me around like a rag doll all day long.
 I know! And I'm an old lady.
Imagine me in my prime.
Ha-ha!
I would have destroyed you!
 I just don't understand why I can't get back
To my former self. It's like...
I'm a step slower.
I'm tentative.
I'm out of sync.
I just can't get back in the groove.
 Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.
 What metal?
 The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body.
Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal
In your own body?
You really are the worst avatar ever.
 I thought Su got it all out.
" No, my girls never really picked up metalbending"
"All that well, if you ask me."
 That's been my problem this entire time!
I gotta get it out.
"You can get it out for me, right?"
 Who do you think you're talking to?
" Once we're done with these, we can go into the middle ring"
And I'll let you pick out some new suits.
Then we'll hit the boutiques in the upper ring for me.
Where did you get those shirts?
" Aces, right?"
Kuvira is my hero.
 They're selling them over there.
 You can't sell that junk in here!
"This is the little Ba Sing Se fashion mall,"
And I'm the little king here!
Respect the brooch!
" Stop it, little king!"
 I am the glorious defender!
 I'm covered in juice! Get him!
 We need to get you out of here.
 Ooh!
It's destiny!
"Look where we are, Mako..."
The royal palace.
The throne!
Out of my way!
 Hey! It's my birthday!
 It's my coronation day!
"You'll have another birthday next year,"
But I'll never have this day back again!
Never!
" Okay, you're losing it."
 This is the worst day of my life!
 Why?
Do you really want to be the king?
"I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator,"
But at least she spent the last few years working hard
To make the earth kingdom somewhat better.
"If you were an earth kingdom citizen,"
Do you think you're the kind of person you want as your king?
What have you ever done for your people?
I'm sorry. That was out of line.
 No. You're right.
No one ever talked to me like that before.
I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved.
 Let's get you out of here and back to some place safe.
 Carry me?
 No.
" Okay. If you want me to bend out this metal,"
You need to relax.
 I am relaxed.
 Ha! Seriously?
Your body is like a twisted tree trunk.
 Just do it! I'm ready!
 It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax!
Stop fighting me!
 I'm not fighting!
Ya!
" All right, that's it."
You're going to have to do this yourself.
"Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there."
 What do you mean?
Why would I want poison inside me?
 I don't know.
Maybe so you have an excuse
Not to go back to being the avatar.
"If you don't get better, you can't do your job,"
So you don't have to worry about getting hurt again.
 What? That's ridiculous.
 Whatever.
"When you want it out,"
You can bend it out.
I can't deal with all your issues for you.
 Wait!
What am I supposed to do now?
 How should I know?
Ask the spirit that brought you here.
"The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang"
"Where no one will bother you,"
You picked the best swamp in the world!
 This is a mission of the utmost importance.
"Conflict is coming to the earth kingdom,"
And we need to find the avatar.
Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?
 You can count on one of us.
I don't know about these two ladies.
" From now on, developing this technology is"
Your number one priority.
 This is going to change everything.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
AFTER KORRA FAILED
"TO RETURN TO REPUBLIC CITY,"
EVERYONE'S BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT HER FATE.
"SO TENZIN TASKED JINORA, IKKI, AND"
MEELO WITH FINDING THE AVATAR.
"UNBEKNOWNST TO THE KIDS,"
KORRA FOUND REFUGE
"IN THE SWAMP WITH TOPH,"
WHO DISCOVERED THERE WAS STILL
METAL POISON IN HER BODY.
BUT WHEN TOPH TRIED REMOVING
"IT, KORRA RESISTED."
WILL THE AIRBENDER KIDS
FIND THE AVATAR
AND HELP HER RETURN TO ACTION?
"TENZIN, ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T"
GO WITH THEM?
 MEELO!
 RAIKO ASKED ME TO STAY HERE
AND HELP FIGURE OUT
A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION
TO THIS KUVIRA PROBLEM.
" MOM, WE'LL BE FINE."
GRANDPA AANG AND HIS FRIENDS
WERE AROUND OUR AGE
WHEN THEY TRAVELED THE WORLD.
"WELL, AT LEAST"
I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU STARVING OUT THERE.
"MOM, WE'RE GOING"
"TO BE IN THE WILD,"
LIVING OFF THE LAND.
WE DON'T NEED YOUR FOOD.
BUT I MADE YOUR FAVORITE TREAT.
SWEET BUNS
WITH HAPPY FACES ON THEM?
"WELL, I GUESS WE'RE NOT"
OFFICIALLY ON THE ROAD YET.
"AW, THIS ONE IS SMUDGED."
I CAN'T EAT THIS.
"YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,"
THINGS GET SMUDGED IN THE WILD.
WERE YOU ABLE TO GET
A READ ON KORRA YET?
"NO, BUT ONCE WE'RE FURTHER OUT,"
I'LL BE ABLE TO HONE IN
ON HER SPIRITUAL ENERGY.
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND HER
WITHIN A FEW DAYS.
"GOOD LUCK, AND BE CAREFUL."
"REMEMBER, JINORA'S IN CHARGE."
 I ANSWER TO NO MAN
"OR GIRL,"
EVEN IF SHE DOES HAVE TATTOOS.
 MEELO.
"NOW, LET'S MOVE OUT, SOLDIERS."
" PEPPER, YIP YIP."
FINALLY!
I'VE BEEN HOLDING MY PEE FOR AN HOUR.
"IF YOU GET THROUGH TO KORRA,"
TELL HER I SAID HI.
DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING YET?
 WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
"IKKI, I CAN'T CONCENTRATE"
IF YOU KEEP TALKING.
WHY DON'T YOU GO PLAY
WITH ONE OF THOSE SPIRITS?
JINORA'S SPIRITY POWERS
"ARE BROKEN,"
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE KORRA IS.
 MY POWERS ARE NOT BROKEN.
I JUST NEED
MORE THAN TWO SECONDS
AND SOME QUIET.
WHILE YOU TRY
"TO PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,"
POKI AND I ARE
GOING TO GO INTO TOWN
AND FIND OUT
IF ANYONE'S SEEN KORRA.
 SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN TO ME.
 ENOUGH CHITCHAT.
YOU CAN HOLD
THE PICTURE OF KORRA I DREW.
 WOW.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DRAW.
YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT OF
"THINGS ABOUT ME, SISTER."
LET'S ROLL.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS WOMAN?
"WELL, AREN'T YOU"
AN ADORABLE LITTLE THING?
I'M NOT ADORABLE. I'M DANGEROUS.
DANGEROUSLY CUTE
WITH THOSE CHEEKS.
 AWW.
 THIS NEVER HAPPENED.
LET'S SPLIT.
 THE AVATAR?
WE STILL HAVE ONE OF THOSE?
"HAVEN'T SEEN HER, KID. SORRY."
MAN!
 CAN I TRUST YOU?
 I GUESS SO.
I'M ON A TOP SECRET MISSION
TO FIND THE AVATAR.
 HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
" I HAVEN'T, SORRY."
"TOP SECRET MISSION, HUH?"
"YEAH, IT'S BEEN"
PRETTY DANGEROUS.
I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS.
REALLY? WHAT KIND OF THINGS?
 CRAZY THINGS.
 COOL.
 I'M MEELO.
"WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU,"
OTHER THAN BEAUTIFUL?
I'M TUYEN. NICE TO MEET YOU.
OOH! MEELO FOUND A GIRLFRIEND.
" GO AWAY, IKKI!"
JINORA'S BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
WE'RE MOVING ON.
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT TO
GET BACK TO YOUR MISSION.
"GOOD LUCK, MEELO."
" THANKS A LOT, IKKI."
YOU DROVE AWAY
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!
"JINORA, IKKI!"
IT'S KORRA!
"WHERE, WHERE, WHERE, WHERE,"
"WHERE, WHERE, WHERE?"
IT'S JUST A PHOTO OF KORRA.
 AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.
" PRETTY NEAT, HUH?"
SHE CAME BY HERE
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.
LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE JUST DRUMMED UP
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED LEAD.
THEN WHERE DID SHE GO?
" OH, I DON'T KNOW,"
BUT SHE WASN'T LOOKING TOO GOOD.
"IKKI, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT."
WHAT? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
"EXACTLY, YOU NEED TO START"
PULLING YOUR WEIGHT.
"THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO,"
SO-CALLED LEADER.
REMEMBER WHEN HE USED TO BE
SO NICE AND SWEET?
 NO.
SO...
WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR TODAY?
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.
BUT WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE THAT.
I KNOW! TELL ME THE STORY ABOUT HOW
YOU TAUGHT AANG TO EARTHBEND.
 WHAT'S THERE TO TELL?
I THREW SOME ROCKS
"AT THE AVATAR,"
"HE GOT ALL WHINY,"
AND SOKKA FELL IN A HOLE.
I THOUGHT THERE'D BE
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME
YOU GUYS TOOK DOWN THE FIRELORD?
 THAT MUST HAVE BEEN EPIC.
" OH, YEAH."
"IT WAS HOT, I WAS ON A BLIMP,"
AND I THINK
A GIANT TURTLE SHOWED UP.
"WOW, WHAT A DAY."
"OKAY, YOU'RE TERRIBLE"
AT TELLING STORIES.
YOU'RE TERRIBLE
AT LISTENING TO THEM.
QUIT MAKING ALL THAT RACKET.
IF YOU'RE SO ANTSY
"TO DO SOMETHING,"
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND COLLECT
SOME MUSHROOMS FOR DINNER?
 YOU GOT IT.
TAKE THE PATH TILL YOU
SEE THE BOULDER WITH A HOLE IN IT.
THEN GO TO YOUR LEFT.
"OH, AND MAKE SURE YOU GET"
"THE BIG, SLIMY ONES."
THEY'RE THE TASTIEST.
"HEY, WHERE'S ALL THE FOOD"
MOM GAVE US?
 I THREW IT IN THE RIVER.
 YOU DID WHAT?
THAT FOOD WAS
SUPPOSED TO LAST US TWO WEEKS.
" HEY, KEEP IT DOWN!"
I'M TRYING TO MEDITATE.
" YEAH, KEEP IT DOWN, IKKI."
MEELO THREW AWAY ALL OUR FOOD!
"FROM NOW ON,"
WE HUNT FOR OUR MEALS.
"MEELO, WE'RE VEGETARIANS."
WE DON'T HUNT.
 ENOUGH WHINING.
POKI AND I WILL GO
FIND SOME GRUB.
MY NAME'S MEELO.
I LIKE TO THROW AWAY FOOD
AND FART AT INAPPROPRIATE MOMENTS.
I'M JINORA. I'M SO ABOVE IT ALL
BECAUSE I'M MEDITATING
ALL THE TIME.
" OH, I'M SORRY."
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.
WAIT!
YOU DROPPED YOUR BREAKFAST!
HEY.
DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE FRIENDS?
YOU'RE TRESPASSING.
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
"ALL RIGHT, LITTLE AIRBENDER."
TELL US WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IN THE EARTH EMPIRE. ARE YOU SPYING?
NO. I SWEAR I'M NOT A SPY.
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
WITH MY BROTHER AND SISTER.
"IT'S OUR FIRST BIG MISSION,"
"AND MY DAD, TENZIN, IS COUNTING ON US."
"BUT IF WE DON'T FIND THE AVATAR,"
HE'S GOING TO BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
"THIS GIRL IS TENZIN'S KID,"
AND SHE'S LOOKING
FOR THE AVATAR.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
" NO, BUT TRY THIS MACAROON."
 GET THAT OUT OF MY FACE!
"LOOK, IF WE CAPTURE"
THESE THREE AIRBENDER KIDS
"AND BRING THEM TO KUVIRA,"
I BET WE'D GET
A BIG-TIME PROMOTION.
YOU MEAN
WE'D GET OUT OF THIS DUMP?
" SORRY, LITTLE LADY."
IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.
SO YOU'RE OUT HERE
WITH YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER.
WHERE'S YOUR CAMPSITE?
 WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
WE JUST WANT TO
GET THE FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.
MAYBE WE COULD SIT
EVERYBODY DOWN
AND HAVE A NICE PLATE
OF MACAROONS.
 WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE?
I FOUND A WHOLE SACK OF FOOD
"DOWN BY THE RIVER,"
AND WITH EACH DELICIOUS SNACK
"COMES A LOVELY,"
HANDWRITTEN NOTE.
"THIS ONE SAYS,"
"""YOU'RE MY HANDSOME LITTLE MAN."""
THAT IS SO TOUCHING.
MY MOM WROTE THOSE NOTES.
THAT'S OUR SACK OF FOOD!
 ENOUGH WITH THE CUTE NOTES!
WHERE ARE YOUR BROTHER
AND SISTER?
 WHO CARES?
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM.
I'D RATHER HANG OUT HERE
WITH YOU GUYS.
HIT ME WITH ONE
OF THOSE MACAROONS.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
" YUP, TOTALLY FINE."
"I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,"
'CAUSE WE FOUND SOME...
WE FOUND SOME BERRIES.
UGH.
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
SOME BAD BERRIES.
SO MUCH FOR LIVING OFF THE LAND.
THEY'RE FINE.
I JUST ATE TOO MANY OF THEM
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO...
SO DELICIOUS.
DID YOU RUN INTO IKKI WHILE YOU WERE
PICKING YOUR POISONOUS BERRIES?
" UH, NO."
"WHAT, DID SHE RUN OFF"
OR SOMETHING?
 I THINK SO.
"GREAT, NOW I GOT TO GO"
FIND THE AVATAR AND HER.
THIS MISSION IS GETTING WORSE
BY THE DAY.
THIS ISN'T ONLY
"YOUR MISSION, MEELO."
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING THIS
AS A FAMILY.
IT SEEMS PRETTY LONELY OUT HERE.
WHERE IS EVERYBODY ELSE?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
" AWW, HE'S JUST UPSET"
BECAUSE KUVIRA'S TAKING
"ALL THE TROOPS TO ZAOFU,"
AND WE HAD TO STAY HERE.
"WELL, IT'S THE LAST CITY LEFT, AND"
THEN THE WHOLE EMPIRE WILL BE UNITED.
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE
A HUGE PARTY AFTERWARDS.
"IT'S TOUGH TO BE LEFT OUT, HUH?"
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
 YOU DO?
 YEAH.
MY BROTHER AND SISTER ARE ALWAYS
LEAVING ME OUT OF FUN STUFF.
"I MEAN, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE"
"LOOKING FOR THE AVATAR TOGETHER,"
BUT THEY WON'T EVEN LET ME HELP.
" WELL, THAT'S NOT FAIR."
MAYBE WE CAN HELP YOU OUT.
SO WHERE HAVE YOU
LOOKED FOR HER?
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING
"DOWN THE WEST COAST,"
AND THE ONLY LEAD WE HAVE
IS SOME GUY
WHO SAID HE SAW HER
SIX MONTHS AGO.
"WELL, WE HAVE TROOPS"
PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE.
"IF ANYONE SAW HER,"
THEY WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT.
 WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE?
"OH, THAT'S THE SWAMP."
NO ONE GOES THERE.
" DON'T GET DISCOURAGED, IKKI."
YOU'RE A VALUABLE MEMBER
"OF THE TEAM, AND YOU HAVE A BIG HEART."
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA FIND HER.
"NOW, LET'S GET YOU"
OUT OF THOSE ROPES.
" YOU'RE WELCOME, IKKI."
 WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
WE'RE SAVING YOU. LET'S GO.
I HAD EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.
"I JUST FOUND OUR FOOD,"
AND I HAVE AN IDEA WHERE KORRA IS.
YOU DO? THEN LET'S GET GOING.
 HOLD ON.
SORRY MY BROTHER AND SISTER
KNOCKED YOU OUT.
NICE CHATTING WITH YOU.
MACAROON.
THERE YOU ARE.
YOU GOT MY DINNER YET?
" NO, THIS SWAMP,"
IT DID CRAZY THINGS TO MY MIND.
I HAD VISIONS
OF ALL THE TIMES
MY ENEMIES HURT ME.
"YEAH, I FIGURED SOMETHING"
LIKE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.
WHAT?
YOU WANTED ME TO SEE THOSE VISIONS?
"YOU ARE ONE TWISTED OLD LADY,"
YOU KNOW THAT?
"LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT"
"TO GET BETTER,"
AND SO DOES THE SWAMP.
IT CAN SENSE
YOU'RE OUT OF BALANCE.
IT'LL TEACH YOU
"WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN,"
IF YOU'RE OPEN TO LISTENING.
"OKAY, SWAMP. I'M ALL EARS."
YOU SAID YOU SAW
YOUR PAST ENEMIES.
"NOW, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?"
"I DON'T KNOW,"
BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE ME
AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE SUFFER.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE CARRYING
"AROUND YOUR FORMER ENEMIES,"
THE SAME WAY YOU'RE STILL CARRYING
AROUND THAT METAL POISON.
YOU EVER CONSIDER MAYBE YOU COULD
LEARN SOMETHING FROM THEM?
SOUNDS LIKE THE SWAMP'S
MESSING WITH YOUR MIND TOO.
"MY MIND IS JUST FINE, THANK YOU."
"LISTEN, WHAT DID AMON WANT?"
EQUALITY FOR ALL.
UNALAQ?
HE BROUGHT BACK THE SPIRITS.
AND ZAHEER BELIEVED IN FREEDOM.
 I GUESS.
"THE PROBLEM WAS, THOSE GUYS"
"WERE TOTALLY OUT OF BALANCE,"
AND THEY TOOK
THEIR IDEOLOGIES TOO FAR.
" OKAY, FINE."
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY THEY KEEP HAUNTING ME.
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO FACE
YOUR FEARS.
YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO DEAL
WITH FUTURE ENEMIES
IF YOU'RE STILL FIGHTING
THE OLD ONES.
"MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT HOW"
AM I SUPPOSED TO MOVE ON?
"BOY, YOU AVATARS SURE NEED"
A LOT OF HAND-HOLDING.
GET UP.
WE'RE GOING
TO THE BANYANGROVE TREE.
THOSE SOLDIERS SAID
"THERE WEREN'T ANY TROOPS HERE,"
AND I FIGURE
"IF KORRA'S NOT FEELING GOOD,"
SHE MIGHT COME TO A SPIRITUAL
PLACE LIKE THIS TO GET BETTER.
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
"OF SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY HERE,"
BUT I DON'T FEEL KORRA.
"WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE GET"
FOR LISTENING TO IKKI.
"GUYS, WE JUST GOT HERE."
LET'S AT LEAST LOOK AROUND.
"I'M SORRY, IKKI,"
BUT I'M WITH MEELO ON THIS.
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GOING TO FIND HER HERE.
"LET'S GO, PEPPER."
AAH!
WHY DID THOSE STUPID VINES
PULL US IN HERE ANYWAY?
 BECAUSE THEY WANT US HERE.
"I'M TELLING YOU,"
KORRA'S GOT TO BE CLOSE.
"I DON'T KNOW, IKKI."
I STILL DON'T SENSE KORRA.
" WELL, YOU HAVEN'T SENSED HER"
THE ENTIRE TIME
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HER.
"NEXT TIME I GO ON A MISSION,"
"IT'S GOING TO BE BOYS ONLY,"
JUST POKI AND ME.
 IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE ROOTS
OF THE BANYANGROVE TREE
SPREAD OUT FOR MILES
"IN EVERY DIRECTION,"
CONNECTING THIS WHOLE SWAMP.
YOUR PROBLEM IS YOU'VE BEEN
"DISCONNECTED FOR TOO LONG,"
DISCONNECTED FROM
THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU
AND DISCONNECTED FROM YOURSELF.
I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO YOU!
KORRA. I KNOW WHERE KORRA IS!
YEAH! - YEAH!
 I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
"I SAW JINORA, IKKI, AND MEELO."
THEY'RE HERE!
 GOOD.
"HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE HERE"
TO TAKE YOU HOME.
KORRA!
"OH, WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH,"
KORRA.
 I MISSED YOU SO MUCH TOO.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?
 JINORA SENSED YOUR ENERGY.
BUT WE NEVER WOULD'VE BEEN
HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR IKKI.
I NEVER WOULD'VE STORMED OFF
AND FOUND THOSE SOLDIERS
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MEELO.
I WAS TRYING
"TO TOUGHEN UP THESE LADIES,"
BUT I GUESS
IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.
 I LOVE YOUR HAIR.
 IT'S SO YOU.
 I-I'M SO SORRY.
"THIS IS MEELO, JINORA, AND IKKI,"
AANG AND KATARA'S GRANDCHILDREN.
YOUR GRANDPA WAS
A REAL PAIN IN MY BUTT.
"WAIT A MINUTE,"
"CRANKY, OLD, BLIND..."
YOU MUST BE TOPH!
" OH, I LIKE THIS ONE."
"YOU NEED TO COME HOME, KORRA."
KUVIRA IS TAKING OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM.
 YOU HAVE TO STOP HER.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT THE AVATAR I USED TO BE.
I CAN'T EVEN
GO INTO THE AVATAR STATE.
" PLEASE, KORRA."
 THE WORLD NEEDS YOU BACK.
" ALL RIGHT, I'M READY."
 I'M NOT BENDING IT OUT OF YOU.
YOU GOT TO DO THIS ON YOUR OWN.
 CLOSE YOUR EYES.
CLEAR YOUR MIND.
AND DON'T FREAK OUT
LIKE LAST TIME.
"NOW, FOCUS YOUR ENERGY."
FIND THE METAL.
LET IT MOVE THROUGH YOUR BODY.
 THAT FIGHT IS OVER.
RELEASE THE FEAR.
" WELL DONE, KORRA."
THE AVATAR IS BACK IN BUSINESS!
 I FEEL SO MUCH LIGHTER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING ME.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A HUG NOW
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
ALL RIGHT. YOU EARNED IT.
" BYE, TOPH!"
" BYE, SEE YOU LATER."
 IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU!
 WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU!
"FINALLY, SOME PEACE AND QUIET."
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
"AFTER THREE YEARS,"
KUVIRA HAS UNITED
THE FORMER EARTH KINGDOM STATES
UNDER HER NEW EARTH EMPIRE BANNER.
ZAOFU.
"DURING THAT SAME TIME, ASAMI REBUILT"
THE COMPANY HER FATHER CREATED
AND HELPED REDESIGN
THE CITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE.
"AND MOST RECENTLY,"
THE AIRBENDER KIDS FOUND THE AVATAR.
KORRA RID HERSELF OF THE
RESIDUAL POISON IN HER BODY
AND IS READY TO RETURN TO ACTION.
 WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY.
 I'LL CONTACT PRESIDENT RAIKO.
HE'LL SEND THE UNITED FORCES.
"CALL WHOMEVER YOU WANT,"
BUT THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT IN TIME.
"KUVIRA'S ALREADY HERE,"
AND SHE BROUGHT HER ENTIRE ARMY.
"BY THIS TIME TOMORROW, MY MOTHER"
"WILL HAVE SIGNED OUR TREATY,"
AND THE EARTH EMPIRE
WILL FINALLY BE UNITED.
 DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.
SECURING YOUR HOMETOWN
WON'T BE LIKE EVERY OTHER CITY.
ZAOFU STOPPED BEING MY HOME
LONG AGO.
I'M READY TO TAKE IT BY FORCE.
 NO.
THE EYES OF THE WORLD ARE ON US NOW.
WE MUST DO THIS RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED BOLIN.
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE CAN RELY ON HIM?
 SU TRUSTS HIM. SHE'LL LISTEN TO HIM.
ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD BE
GOING TO ZAOFU?
DAD WANTED US TO BRING YOU
BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY.
IF KUVIRA'S HEADING
"TO ZAOFU, SO AM I."
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT THE AVATAR IS BACK.
THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW.
 WHOO-HOO!
AVATAR FIGHT!
THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!
" MEELO, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A FIGHT."
KUVIRA SAVED MY DAD.
SHE WAS A CAPTAIN IN SU'S GUARD.
I THINK SHE CAN BE REASONED WITH.
 WHAT? NO FIGHT?
WHY DID WE GO THROUGH ALL
THAT TROUBLE TO SAVE YOU
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BEAT SOMEONE UP?
" ZHU LI, IS THIS THING ON?"
" WE'RE ROLLING, SIR."
"OKAY, I'M VARRICK OF VARRICK"
"INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL,"
AND THIS IS SPIRIT VINE EXPERIMENT 3-02.
HAND ME THE THING.
IN THIS STASIS CAPSULE IS A
PRESERVED SPIRIT VINE SAMPLE
WEIGHING APPROXIMATELY TWO ZHU LIS.
I HAVE POSTULATED
THAT THESE SPIRIT VINES
ARE A FORM OF PURE ENERGY
THAT'S UNSTABLE
IN WHAT WE CALL
"""TYPICAL EARTH CONDITIONS."""
THIS MACHINE SHOULD TRANSFER
THE ENERGY FROM THE VINE
INTO A BATTERY
"USING ELECTRICAL CURRENTS,"
"REVERSE MAGNETIC POLARITY,"
AND A LITTLE-KNOWN PHENOMENON
I CALL THE VARRI-EFFECT.
IT'S WORKING.
IT'S REGISTERING FIVE VARRICKS
OF POWER...
NOW SEVEN VARRICKS.
WHOA. WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 OH!
 AHH!
"ZHU LI, SHUT IT DOWN."
THERE ARE TOO MANY VARRICKS.
AHH!
 AHH!
SIR...
YOU'RE TOO HEAVY.
"YOU KNOW, YOU COULD STAND"
TO LOSE A FEW ZHU LIS.
" I THINK YOU'RE JUST WEAK, SIR."
PULL HARDER.
AHH! - AHH!
" VARRICK, YOU SAVED ME."
 OF COURSE I SAVED YOU.
I CAN'T CLEAN THIS PLACE UP BY MYSELF.
GRAB A BROOM.
 WHAT HAPPENED? WERE WE ATTACKED?
"NO, WE WERE SPIRIT-VINED,"
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M PUTTING THE KIBOSH ON THIS PROJECT.
" NO, YOU'RE NOT."
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT WE CAN DO
WITH THIS KIND OF POWER?
" YES, I DO."
AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO
PUT AN END TO IT.
WHAT IF IT FELL INTO THE WRONG HANDS?
SINCE WHEN DOES THAT MATTER
TO YOU?
" I KNOW. IT'S NOT LIKE ME, RIGHT?"
"USUALLY, I LOOK AT A PROJECT LIKE THIS,"
"AND ALL I THINK IS, ""WOW, I CAN MAKE A"
"TON OF MONEY OFF THIS."""
"BUT RECENTLY, I'VE BEEN HAVING"
THESE STRANGE FEELINGS INSIDE.
IT'S LIKE I'M... CONCERNED WITH OTHERS.
AND THERE'S THIS NAGGING
VOICE IN MY HEAD
CONSTANTLY TELLING ME
WHAT'S RIGHT FROM WRONG.
I BELIEVE THAT VOICE
"IS YOUR CONSCIENCE, SIR."
"WELL, I'M THE OTHER VOICE"
"IN YOUR HEAD,"
"AND I'M TELLING YOU,"
YOU WILL CONTINUE THIS PROJECT.
" SORRY, NO."
I JUST REALLY GOT TO STAND
MY GROUND ON THIS ONE.
WHOA!
NOW THERE'S A VOICE
IN MY HEAD TELLING ME
TO DROP YOU ON THE TRACKS.
SHOULD I LISTEN?
" NO, NO."
HEAD VOICES ARE LIARS.
WHAT DO HEAD VOICES KNOW?
I'LL WORK ON THE PROJECT.
PLEASE DON'T DROP ME.
AHH!
" ASAMI, YOU CAME."
I'M HERE TO RETURN THESE.
 YOU NEVER OPENED THEM.
 STOP WRITING ME.
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
OR HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.
" PLEASE, JUST LET ME SAY ONE THING,"
THEN I'LL NEVER CONTACT YOU AGAIN.
I CAN'T FORGIVE MYSELF FOR ALL
"THE HORRIBLE THINGS I'VE DONE,"
AND I NEVER EXPECT YOU TO FORGIVE ME.
I TORE OUR FAMILY APART
AND DESTROYED OUR GOOD NAME.
"BUT IN A LIFE OF REGRET,"
YOU'RE THE ONE THING I LOOK
BACK ON THAT MAKES ME SMILE.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
"I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, ASAMI."
YOU ARE THE GREATEST THING
I EVER CREATED.
 AM I IN TROUBLE?
" NO. IN FACT, I HAVE GOOD NEWS."
WE WANT YOU TO BE PART
OF OUR INNER CIRCLE.
 INNER CIRCLE! NO WAY! YES!
"AHEM, THAT IS A GREAT HONOR."
"WHAT DOES IT MEAN, EXACTLY?"
 IT MEANS YOU'VE PROVEN YOUR WORTH.
"WE'RE SO CLOSE TO UNITING THE EMPIRE,"
BUT SU HAS SOME RESENTMENT
TOWARDS ME AND BAATAR
THAT MIGHT CLOUD HER JUDGMENT
AND STOP HER FROM MAKING
A WISE DECISION.
WE BELIEVE YOU CAN HELP HER
SEE CLEARLY.
 I CAN DO THAT.
BY THE TIME I'M FINISHED TELLING HER
"ALL THE GREAT THINGS WE'VE DONE,"
SHE'LL BE BEGGING TO JOIN.
" GOOD, BECAUSE WE'RE HERE."
AREN'T ALL THESE TROOPS
GONNA SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE?
THE ARMY IS HERE
TO PROJECT STRENGTH.
YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT PEACE.
" OPAL, YOU'RE HERE TOO."
" NO, YOU'VE CHOSEN YOUR SIDE."
 SIDES? THERE SHOULDN'T BE SIDES.
"I KNOW, WHY DON'T WE ALL STAND"
"IN A CIRCLE, HUH,"
MAYBE HOLD HANDS?
 I'M NOT GIVING UP ZAOFU.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU BROUGHT
YOUR ENTIRE ARMY.
"SU, I DIDN'T BRING MY ARMY"
TO THREATEN YOU.
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU ALL THAT YOUR
SON AND I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED.
YOU MUST REALIZE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING
YOUR FATHER AND I TRIED TO TEACH YOU.
" SON, YOU BELONG HERE."
 WHY?
SO THAT I CAN GO ON LIVING
IN YOUR SHADOW?
 DON'T SAY THAT.
CAN'T YOU SEE SHE'S BRAINWASHED YOU?
" HA, I DIDN'T BRAINWASH HIM."
I SET HIM FREE.
AND NOW HE'S ACCOMPLISHED
MORE WITH ME
THAN HE EVER COULD HAVE WITH YOU.
"OKAY, GUYS, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A LOT"
"OF PERSONAL, PAINFUL HISTORY HERE."
SO WHAT DO SAY WE JUST ALL
"FORGET ABOUT THAT STUFF, HUH?"
"I MEAN, THAT'S THE PAST."
"RIGHT, WING? RIGHT, WEI?"
YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
HIGH FIVE.
"ALL RIGHT. NO, IT'S COOL."
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO?
FOCUS ON THE FUTURE.
AND THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT.
LET ME TELL YOU.
"I'VE SEEN IT. YEAH, SAW IT LAST MONTH."
WE WENT TO THIS TOWN
THAT HAD NOTHING.
MOST OF THE PEOPLE THERE HAD NEVER
EVEN SEEN A SATOMOBILE BEFORE.
"BUT NOW THEY HAVE TWO SATOMOBILES,"
"RUNNING WATER, AND A MAGNET TRAIN"
THAT GOES RIGHT THROUGH THEIR TOWN.
"I MEAN, HOW AWESOME IS THAT?"
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY
"WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED,"
BUT I'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER YOU LEAVE.
CITIZENS ARE FORCED TO WORK
AS SLAVE LABOR.
DISSENTERS ARE SENT OFF
TO WHO KNOWS WHERE.
" YOU'RE WRONG, OPAL."
"NOW, I DON'T KNOW"
"WHAT YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN,"
BUT I'M GIVING YOU
THE 100% BOLIN GUARANTEE
THAT WE'RE MAKING THE EARTH
EMPIRE A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BROUGHT BOLIN
HERE TO TRY TO SWAY US.
LEAVE.
ZAOFU WILL NEVER ACCEPT YOU
AS THEIR LEADER.
 THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO AGREE
"TO JOIN THE EMPIRE,"
OR WE TAKE THE CITY BY FORCE.
 I SEE IT. ZAOFU.
WE MADE IT.
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE
ARE HERE TOO.
"OH, NO."
I HOPE WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.
 KORRA?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
YOU DISAPPEARED.
EVERYONE WAS SO WORRIED.
I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY LATER.
"RIGHT NOW, I WANT"
TO HELP YOU STOP KUVIRA.
WHAT CAN I DO?
" YOU WERE JUST BLUFFING, RIGHT?"
"I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT REALLY"
GOING TO ATTACK ZAOFU... ARE YOU?
" WHEN PEOPLE DON'T COOPERATE,"
WE MUST FIND OTHER WAYS
OF CONVINCING THEM TO JOIN.
 OTHER WAYS?
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE USED
THESE OTHER WAYS IN THE PAST?
 IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT.
 SO... WHAT DOES HAPPEN
TO ALL OF THOSE TOWNS
AND VILLAGES AFTER WE LEAVE?
I JUST REALIZED I'VE NEVER REALLY GONE
BACK AND CHECKED ON THEM.
THOSE PEOPLE
"ARE MY LOYAL SUBJECTS,"
AND THEY CONTRIBUTE TO
THE EMPIRE HOWEVER I SEE FIT.
"NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE INNER CIRCLE,"
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT
SOME HARD TRUTHS.
MAYBE I'M NOT REALLY
AN INNER-CIRCLE KIND OF GUY.
OR... OR MAYBE
WE DON'T TAKE OVER ZAOFU.
WE COULD JUST LET THEM BE
"ON THEIR OWN,"
"THEN YAY, THE EMPIRE'S UNITED."
CONGRATULATIONS TO US.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS FOR OPAL
WERE STRONGER THAN
YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.
ZAOFU WILL JOIN US.
THE ONLY THING I'M SECOND-GUESSING
IS THE DECISION TO BRING YOU ALONG.
MAYBE YOU NEED TO SPEND SOME
TIME IN A REEDUCATION CAMP.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE WE SEND
PEOPLE TO LEARN NEW TRADE SKILLS.
" HARD TRUTHS, BOLIN."
YOUR LOYALTY
SEEMS TO BE WAVERING.
" NO, NO, I'M TOTALLY ON YOUR SIDE,"
COMPLETELY 100% LOYAL.
HOW DID THINGS GET SO BAD
BETWEEN YOU AND KUVIRA?
I THOUGHT SHE WAS YOUR PROTEGE.
 SHE WAS MORE THAN THAT.
SHE WAS LIKE A DAUGHTER TO ME.
I TOOK HER IN WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS
OLD AND NOURISHED HER TALENTS.
"KUVIRA WAS SMART, A NATURAL LEADER,"
AND QUICKLY ROSE THROUGH THE RANKS.
I SAW MYSELF IN HER.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
"THREE YEARS AGO,"
"AFTER THE FALL OF THE EARTH QUEEN,"
RAIKO AND TENZIN CAME TO SEE ME.
 THE EARTH KINGDOM IS IN CHAOS.
"THERE'S A VACUUM OF POWER,"
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF SOMEONE DOESN'T
TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.
AND DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD BE THE ONE?
YOU'RE THE PERFECT PERSON
TO TAKE CHARGE.
"THE WORLD LEADERS TRUST YOU,"
"AND AS A BEIFONG,"
YOU HAVE CREDIBILITY
IN THE EARTH KINGDOM.
I'M HONORED
"THAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME,"
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN IMPOSING MY
IDEALS ON AN ENTIRE NATION.
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP YOU.
" SUYIN, I KNOW THIS ISN'T MY PLACE,"
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THIS.
ZAOFU HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BEACON
"OF MODERN PROGRESS,"
AND NOW YOU CAN SHARE THAT
WITH EVERYONE.
" WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO,"
MARCH INTO BA SING SE WITH AN ARMY?
WE'D BE SEEN AS CONQUERORS
AND GREETED WITH NOTHING BUT WAR.
 THERE ARE ALREADY WARS.
THE EARTH QUEEN NEARLY
DESTROYED OUR NATION.
THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE THINGS.
 IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
"I DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME,"
BUT THAT MOMENT CREATED A RIFT
BETWEEN US.
KUVIRA TURNED MY OWN SON AGAINST ME.
AND TOGETHER THEY PLOTTED
BEHIND MY BACK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
WE'RE DOING WHAT YOU
DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO.
WE'RE GOING TO BA SING SE
TO HELP BRING ORDER
BACK TO THE EARTH KINGDOM.
 NO. YOU WILL STAY HERE.
 AND WHO'S GOING TO STOP ME?
YOUR SECURITY FORCE
WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO JOIN MY CAUSE.
THEY'RE SOME OF THE
"BEST FIGHTERS IN THE WORLD,"
AND THEY ARE TIRED OF BEING TREATED
LIKE EXOTIC BIRDS IN YOUR CAGE.
"IF YOU LEAVE NOW,"
YOU WILL NEVER BE WELCOMED BACK.
"WHEN I CHOOSE TO RETURN,"
IT WILL BE ON MY OWN TERMS.
KUVIRA AND BAATAR LEFT
"THAT DAY WITH VARRICK,"
"MY SECURITY FORCE, AND A FEW OF"
ZAOFU'S WEALTHIEST CITIZENS.
AFTER KUVIRA PROVED HERSELF
"BY STABILIZING BA SING SE,"
RAIKO AND THE OTHER
WORLD LEADERS MADE HER
THE PROVISIONAL HEAD
OF THE EARTH KINGDOM.
"ONCE SHE REFUSED TO STEP DOWN,"
I KNEW IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL SHE MADE HER WAY BACK HERE.
 I WANT TO FIX THIS.
 YOU CAN.
GO INTO THE AVATAR STATE
AND DEMOLISH HER ARMY.
REMOVE KUVIRA FROM POWER
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
FIGHTING IS SOMETHING
"THE OLD ME WOULD DO,"
BUT THAT ALWAYS MADE THINGS WORSE.
LET ME TALK WITH KUVIRA.
MAYBE I CAN REASON WITH HER.
 KUVIRA DOESN'T LISTEN TO REASON.
I CAN'T BELIEVE KUVIRA
LOCKED ME IN HERE LIKE A PRISONER.
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.
I THINK I'M RUNNING OUT OF AIR.
"ZHU LI, HOLD YOUR BREATH."
 I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH.
 GREAT. NOW WE'RE BOTH GONNA DIE.
 VARRICK.
VARRICK.
" AUGH, AND THE HEAD VOICES ARE BACK."
"BOLIN, THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE."
WHERE DID THAT HATCH COME FROM?
FORGET THE HATCH.
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.
"WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING"
IMPORTANT I'VE GOT TELL YOU TOO.
KUVIRA'S CRAZY.
 KUVIRA'S CRAZY.
 HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?
WHEN I REFUSED TO BUILD HER
"A SUPER WEAPON,"
SHE THREATENED MY LIFE.
"SHE THREATENED ME TOO,"
AND SHE'S THREATENING ZAOFU.
AND IT TURNS OUT SHE'S BEEN
THREATENING VILLAGES THIS WHOLE TIME.
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
" I COULDN'T AGREE MORE, KID."
 WE HAVE AN UNEXPECTED GUEST.
THE AVATAR IS HERE TO SEE YOU.
"KORRA, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR"
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
"THE LAST I HEARD, YOU WERE STILL"
HEALING IN THE SOUTH POLE.
" WELL, I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER NOW."
 THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.
I'M HERE TO ASK YOU
TO BACK DOWN.
"PLEASE, TAKE YOUR ARMY AND LEAVE."
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
 I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE ZAOFU.
"LOOK, I WAS TASKED WITH BRINGING"
STABILITY TO THE EARTH KINGDOM.
ZAOFU IS THE LAST HOLDOUT.
WHY SHOULD I TREAT IT
DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER STATE?
 WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE JUST
"TRYING TO DO SU A FAVOR,"
BUT YOU CAN'T COME TO ME
AS I'M ON THE VERGE
OF REUNITING MY NATION
AND TELL ME TO STOP.
THE WORLD WAS DESCENDING INTO
CHAOS WHILE YOU WERE GONE.
"IN ORDER TO FIX IT,"
I HAD TO MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS.
 I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
I'VE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE
MAD AT ME ABOUT DECISIONS I'VE MADE.
 EXACTLY.
"KORRA, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP,"
GO BACK TO SU AND TRY TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HER.
LET'S CALL A TEMPORARY TRUCE.
I WON'T MAKE ANY MOVES
UNTIL YOU TALK TO HER
AND GET BACK TO ME.
 MAYBE THAT WILL BE FOR THE BEST.
 HAVE YOU SEEN BOLIN?
"HE CAME BY TO SEE VARRICK,"
BUT WE TURNED HIM AWAY.
 OPEN THE DOOR.
WE HAVE SOME FUGITIVES TO CATCH.
"OKAY, I SAY WE GO UP"
AND AROUND THE MOUNTAINS
AND SNEAK INTO ZAOFU FROM THE REAR.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ZAOFU.
THAT PLACE IS DOOMED.
WE'VE GOT TO HEAD TO REPUBLIC CITY.
"WHAT? NO. NO, NO, NO."
WE'VE GOT TO HELP HERE.
WE'LL BE HELPING
BY WARNING THE WORLD
ABOUT KUVIRA'S POTENTIAL
SUPER WEAPON.
" WELL, THAT IS HELPING,"
BUT IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT TYPE OF HELPING.
"HMM, LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS."
AHH!
 ARGH!
 AHH!
 ARGH!
AHH! AHH!
THAT'S NOT THE FLAMETHROWER.
WHAT IDIOT DESIGNED THESE THINGS?
" YOU DID, SIR."
"LESS LECTURING,"
MORE SAVING MY LIFE.
 UGH!
AHH!
ARGH!
 OH!
 ARGH!
 AHH!
UGH.
AHH!
ARGH!
ARGH!
" HEY, I THINK I FIGURED IT OUT."
 AHH!
"SIR, YOU'RE MAKING THIS VERY DIFFICULT."
AHH!
 ARGH!
YAH!
 AUGH!
 AHH!
 ARGH!
ARGH!
 AUGH!
AHH!
 AHH!
AHH-AHH!
ARGH!
 STOP.
TURN YOURSELF OVER OR ELSE.
" THANKS A LOT, ZHU LI."
 YOU CAME BACK.
" WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE,"
IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED
TO TELL YOU FACE-TO-FACE
THAT I NEVER WANTED TO SEE
OR HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.
"I WANTED MY WORDS TO HURT YOU,"
SO THAT YOU WOULD KNOW
HOW YOU HURT ME.
 I'M SORRY.
"BUT WHEN I SAW YOU,"
IT WASN'T ANGER I FELT.
IT WAS SADNESS.
YOU TAINTED OUR PAST AND
DESTROYED OUR FUTURE TOGETHER.
 I WANT TO MAKE AMENDS.
I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER
"BE ABLE TO FORGIVE YOU,"
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I SHOULDN'T TRY.
I THOUGHT WE COULD PLAY
"SOME PAI SHO,"
LIKE WE USED TO.
 NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER.
AUGH!
 DON'T TORTURE US.
SEND THESE THREE AWAY
ON THE NEXT TRAIN.
BOLIN AND ZHU LI WILL BE GOING
TO THE REEDUCATION CAMP
FOR OUR MOST SEVERE DISSENTERS.
AND YOU WILL CONTINUE WORK
ON THE SPIRIT ENERGY PROJECT
"UNDER CLOSE, ARMED SUPERVISION."
I WANT IT WEAPONIZED IMMEDIATELY.
" PLEASE, HAVE MERCY ON ME."
DON'T SEND ME AWAY. TAKE ME BACK.
 WHY WOULD I?
BECAUSE MY ONLY MISTAKE
WAS BEING LOYAL TO THE WRONG PERSON.
"I WAS BLINDLY DEVOTED TO VARRICK,"
AND I LOOKED PAST ALL
THE TIMES HE RIDICULED ME
OR ORDERED ME AROUND OR
"MADE ME CLEAN HIS DISGUSTING FEET,"
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE POSSESSED
THE MOST BRILLIANT MIND
"IN THE WORLD, BUT WHEN I MET YOU,"
I REALIZED I WAS WRONG.
"COMPARED TO YOU, VARRICK'S A FOOL."
" HEY, COME ON. I'M RIGHT HERE."
I BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING
"YOU'VE DONE,"
AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR VISION.
I WANT TO DEVOTE MY LIFE TO YOU.
"I PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE TO YOU,"
GREAT UNITER.
YOU TWO COULD LEARN
SOMETHING FROM HER.
"RISE, ZHU LI."
I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.
 THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
WE'RE PARTNERS. WE HAVE HISTORY.
I DID EVERYTHING
"YOU EVER ASKED OF ME,"
AND YOU NEVER APPRECIATED IT.
"GUARDS, DO THE THING."
" NO, NOT THE THING."
ZHU LI.
WHERE'S SU?
I HAVE TO TALK TO HER.
 SHE'S NOT HERE.
SHE TOOK WING AND WEI.
THEY'RE GOING TO SNEAK INTO
KUVIRA'S CAMP AND PUT AN END TO THIS.
 NO.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
KUVIRA THREATENS
TO TAKE ZAOFU BY FORCE.
AFTER TENSIONS FLARED
BETWEEN SU BEIFONG
"AND HER FORMER PROTEGE,"
KORRA BROKERED A TRUCE.
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.
SU AND HER SONS WERE ALREADY
ON THEIR WAY
TO PUT AN END TO KUVIRA.
"MEANWHILE, BOLIN AND VARRICK"
LEARNED OF KUVIRA'S
TRUE TYRANNICAL INTENT
AND DESERTED HER ARMY.
BUT THEY WERE CAPTURED
AND BETRAYED BY ZHU LI.
NOW THEY'RE BEING HELD
AGAINST THEIR WILL.
 ARE YOU SURE THIS WILL WORK?
"EVEN WITHOUT KUVIRA,"
THEY COULD STILL CRUSH US.
MOST OF THIS ARMY
HAS BEEN FORCED
INTO SERVICE BY KUVIRA.
"IF WE TAKE HER OUT, THEY'LL"
HAVE NO REASON TO FIGHT.
TONIGHT WE END
HER REIGN OF TERROR.
SHE'S ALONE IN THERE.
NOW'S OUR CHANCE.
 DON'T HURT ME!
 ZHU LI?
I KNEW YOU'D TRY A SNEAK ATTACK.
YOU WERE AFRAID TO STEP UP
AND LEAD THE EARTH KINGDOM
"WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE,"
YOU WERE AFRAID TO JOIN ME
"WHEN I BECAME THE LEADER,"
AND NOW YOU'RE AFRAID
OF A FAIR FIGHT.
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A COWARD.
TAKE THEM.
"KORRA, YOU HAVE TO GO STOP SU"
BEFORE SHE DOES
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.
STOP HER?
WE SHOULD BE HELPING HER!
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOUR
MOM IS OR WHAT HER PLAN IS.
IF WE GO CHARGING
"INTO KUVIRA'S CAMP,"
WE COULD GET THEM ALL CAPTURED
OR WORSE.
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT.
"ATTENTION, CITIZENS OF ZAOFU."
"YOUR LEADER, SU BEIFONG,"
ATTEMPTED TO ATTACK ME
"TONIGHT WHILE I SLEPT,"
IGNORING THE TERMS OF OUR TRUCE.
"LUCKILY, I NOW HAVE HER AND"
HER ASSAULT TEAM IN CUSTODY.
 NO.
REST ASSURED
THAT I WILL NOT TAKE REVENGE
ON THE PEACEFUL CITIZENS
"OF ZAOFU,"
AS LONG AS
YOUR REMAINING REPRESENTATIVES
MEET ME OUTSIDE THE CITY
AT DAWN TO OFFER
THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL
SURRENDER OF YOUR CITY.
THAT IS ALL.
"KORRA, YOU CAN'T LET KUVIRA"
GET AWAY WITH THIS.
WE HAVE TO GO BREAK OUT
MOM AND MY BROTHERS.
YOU SWORE AN OATH
OF NONAGGRESSION
WHEN YOU BECAME AN AIRBENDER.
YOU CAN'T JUST ATTACK KUVIRA.
 I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE OATH.
I HAVE TO SAVE MY FAMILY.
" NO, JINORA IS RIGHT."
YOUR MOM ATTACKED THE CAMP.
KUVIRA WAS
JUST DEFENDING HERSELF.
 DEFENDING HERSELF?
SHE WAS GOING
TO ATTACK OUR CITY!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REFUSING TO FIGHT.
WHY IS THAT LOUDSPEAKER LADY
TALKING
WHEN I'M TRYING TO SLEEP?
"KORRA, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?"
JINORA AND I WILL GO
"TALK TO KUVIRA AT DAWN,"
AND MAYBE WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT.
I PROMISE I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO KEEP THE PEACE.
 I'LL GO WITH YOU.
" WE'LL GO, TOO."
 NO.
"DAD TOLD US TO FIND KORRA,"
AND WE FOUND HER.
NOW YOU NEED TO STAY SAFE.
" COME ON, LET US HELP."
I CAN'T RISK ANYONE ELSE
BEING CAPTURED.
YOU CAN STAY
WITH BAATAR AND HUAN
WHILE I WORK THIS OUT
WITH KUVIRA.
MAKE SURE THEY GET BACK
TO TENZIN SAFELY
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.
" AW, MAN."
WHEN AM I GONNA SEE SOME ACTION?
 COOKIE JAR EMPTY.
NO HOT TOWELS.
WAXY BUILDUP.
ZHU LI!
" AW, SHE REALLY IS GONE."
"UP AND AT 'EM, VARRICK."
TIME TO GO TO WORK.
WE HAVE ANOTHER LAB
SET UP FOR YOU.
KUVIRA WANTS THE SPIRIT VINE
WEAPON OPERATIONAL
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
ZHU LI ALWAYS GREETED ME
IN THE MORNING
WITH A... A HOT CUP OF TEA.
YOU'LL GET YOUR TEA
WHEN YOU START WORKING.
"WELL, I'M REALLY ONLY PRODUCTIVE"
"FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES A DAY,"
USUALLY IN THE AFTERNOON
AROUND 3:45.
YOU'LL WORK NOW.
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME
HOW THE DEVICE WORKS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
GO BACK TO SLEEP.
WE ONLY NEED VARRICK.
YOU'LL NEED YOUR ENERGY WHEN
YOU GET TO THE REEDUCATION CAMP.
I CAN'T BE EXPECTED
TO WORK WITHOUT AN ASSISTANT.
"WITHOUT ZHU LI, I'M HELPLESS."
ONE OF THE GUARDS
WILL BE YOUR ASSISTANT.
I'LL BE SUPERVISING.
" WELL, I GUESS HE'LL BE FINE,"
AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T
NEED HIS HANDS AFTERWARDS.
"WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT, SIR?"
THE LAST TIME WE WORKED
"WITH THE SPIRIT VINES,"
IT CREATED
AN UNCONTROLLABLE BLAST
THAT BURNED THROUGH A WALL
AND COULD STILL BE
"BLOWING UP COMETS IN SPACE,"
AS FAR AS I KNOW.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO ASSIST ME
IF I WERE YOU.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
LET THE KID HELP HIM OUT.
FINE. BOLIN CAN ASSIST.
"WAIT, WHAT? I NEED MY HANDS!"
"UH, HOLD ON."
CAN WE GET BREAKFAST FIRST?
WHILE WE STILL HAVE HANDS?
 RELEASE THEM NOW!
IF SU AGREES TO BOW TO ME
"AND TURN OVER ZAOFU,"
SHE AND THE REST OF YOUR
FAMILY WILL NOT BE HARMED.
NEVER! I'LL NEVER BOW TO YOU!
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
FOR US TO RESOLVE THIS.
"I'VE ALREADY LAID OUT MY TERMS,"
AND I THINK
THEY'RE VERY REASONABLE.
"AFTER ALL, SU DID TRY"
TO TAKE ME OUT
DURING
OUR PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS.
YOU CALL BRINGING AN ARMY
TO THREATEN OUR CITY PEACEFUL?
 WHERE'S BOLIN?
I KNOW HE WOULD NEVER
GO ALONG WITH THIS!
" BOLIN IS WITH MY FIANCE,"
WORKING ON SOMETHING
"VERY IMPORTANT,"
BUT I ASSURE YOU
HE'S ON BOARD WITH MY PLANS.
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN APART
FOR SOME TIME.
I GUESS YOU DON'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH BOLIN HAS GROWN UP.
NOW TURN OVER ZAOFU.
I CAN'T JUST LET YOU
TAKE THE CITY.
"AVATAR KORRA,"
YOU ARE INTERFERING
WITH INTERNAL EARTH EMPIRE
BUSINESS
AND LETTING
YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS
GET IN THE WAY OF REASON.
ZAOFU CANNOT
CONTINUE TO RULE ITSELF.
THEY HAVE BEEN HOARDING
THEIR RICHES
AND TECHNOLOGY TOO LONG.
I'M HERE TO DISTRIBUTE
THOSE RESOURCES FAIRLY
THROUGHOUT THE NATION.
THIS IS ABOUT EQUALITY.
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT EQUALITY!
THIS IS ABOUT CONTROL!
JUST TAKE HER DOWN.
YOU KNOW
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS!
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP ME FROM MARCHING
INTO ZAOFU
IS IF YOU PHYSICALLY STOP ME.
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME A CHOICE.
 FINE.
I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW
THAT I WOULD NEVER
ASK ANY OF YOU TO DO SOMETHING
THAT I'M NOT WILLING
TO DO MYSELF.
"SO RATHER THAN RISK YOUR LIVES,"
I WILL FIGHT THE AVATAR
ONE-ON-ONE.
"KORRA, IF YOU WIN,"
THEN YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH ZAOFU.
"BUT AFTER I BEAT YOU,"
I WANT YOU OUT OF MY BUSINESS
FOR GOOD.
I'M THE ONE WHO BROUGHT PEACE
"TO THE EARTH EMPIRE, NOT YOU."
YOU'RE NOT RELEVANT HERE
ANYMORE.
FINE.
YOU WANT TO FIGHT THE AVATAR?
THEN LET'S FINISH THIS
"RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW!"
ARE YOU REALLY READY
TO FIGHT HER?
JUST STAY BACK
AND LET ME HANDLE THIS.
"IT'S BEEN A WHILE,"
BUT I GOT A LOT OF PENT-UP RAGE.
DON'T MESS AROUND.
KUVIRA IS TOO GOOD.
JUST GO INTO THE AVATAR STATE
AND GET IT OVER WITH.
"NO, I'M ONLY GOING"
TO USE THAT AS A LAST RESORT.
 BE CAREFUL.
"USE WHATEVER YOU WANT,"
"ALL THE ELEMENTS,"
"THE AVATAR STATE,"
ANYTHING YOU NEED.
I KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE RUSTY.
 ENOUGH TALK.
LOOKS LIKE THE AVATAR
IS A LITTLE OFF HER GAME.
DON'T LET HER
GET YOU FRUSTRATED!
SHE WANTS YOU TO MAKE A MISTAKE!
" BOLIN, DO THE THING."
 WHAT THING?
 THE THING!
I NEVER HAD TO TELL ZHU LI
WHAT THING!
" I'M NOT ZHU LI, OKAY?"
PRETEND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
ALSO PRETEND I DON'T WANT
TO BUILD A SUPER WEAPON
OR GET MY HANDS BLOWN OFF.
WALK ME THROUGH
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I WANT TO KNOW
EVERY DETAIL OF YOUR WORK.
"YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED"
"WORKING WITH THE VINES,"
"THE POINT WAS TO FIND A CLEAN,"
"UNLIMITED SOURCE OF ENERGY,"
NOT DEVELOP
SOME SPIRITY DEATH RAY.
"CLEAN ENERGY, SOUNDS GREAT!"
WHO DOESN'T LIKE THAT STUFF?
LET'S DO THAT INSTEAD.
 QUIET.
"YOU'RE HERE TO HELP, NOT TALK."
AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD REALIZE
"THAT ONCE A DISCOVERY IS MADE,"
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY
AS SCIENTISTS
"TO PURSUE IT AS FAR AS WE CAN,"
WHEREVER IT LEADS.
 HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU COULDN'T DISCOVER A WOLF-BAT
IF IT WAS BUILDING A NEST
IN YOUR BUTT.
OOH.
 YOU'RE PATHETIC.
WOLF-BATS DON'T BUILD NESTS.
"OOH, YOU GOT ME THERE,"
DR. SCIENCE.
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW IT FEELS
"TO GIVE BIRTH TO GENIUS,"
ONLY TO HAVE IT KIDNAPPED
AND RAISED BY FOOLS.
"ARE YOU DONE WITH YOUR RAMBLING,"
OR DO THE GUARDS
NEED TO ENCOURAGE YOU
TO CONTINUE YOUR WORK?
" OKAY, OKAY, OKAY."
THE LAST TIME WE RAN
"THE CURRENT THROUGH THE VINE,"
WE COULDN'T CONTROL THE POWER.
SO I'M TRYING SOMETHING NEW
TO SEE IF I CAN DIRECT IT.
" COME ON, AVATAR."
GET UP.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
 WE HAVE TO HELP HER.
NO. STAY BACK.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
SO I SEE HOW THE CURRENT
"INTERACTS WITH THE VINE,"
AND HERE IS
"A KIND OF DIRECTIONAL TUBE,"
BUT THIS BAFFLING
HERE AT THE BASE...
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT WOULD
ONLY REDIRECT THE ENERGY
RIGHT BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM.
AND WHAT'S THAT PIECE OF
EQUIPMENT YOU'RE FIDDLING WITH
NOW ON THE POWER SOURCE?
HAND ME THE
"SCREW-TURN-THINGY, WOULD YA?"
"UGH, I CAN'T BELIEVE"
YOU'RE HELPING THEM.
YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
" FUNNY STORY, BOLIN."
I FIRST GOT THE IDEA
FOR HARNESSING SPIRIT POWER
WHEN I WATCHED
THAT GIANT UNALAQ MONSTER
ATTACK THE CITY
FROM MY JAIL CELL.
THAT GIANT MONSTER SET ME FREE.
"TRUST ME, KID."
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.
HUH.
"OKAY, STAND BACK."
THERE WE GO.
 WHAT'S THAT TICKING?
 THAT'S THE TIMER.
 THE TIMER FOR WHAT?
" FOR THE BOMB, OF COURSE!"
WHAT? WHAT BOMB?
THE BOMB THAT'S GOING
TO EXPLODE IN FIVE MINUTES
"AND DESTROY THIS ENTIRE TRAIN,"
"ALL OF THE SPIRIT VINES,"
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS.
"YOU KNOW WHAT, I'D GET"
OUT OF HERE IF I WERE YOU.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
"I'VE BUILT A TIMER,"
AND IT MIGHT RUN A LITTLE FAST.
BOLIN AND I ARE READY
TO GO DOWN WITH THE SHIP...
OR TRAIN IN THIS CASE...
BUT YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU HAVE A LOT TO LIVE FOR.
" NO, NO, NO, NO!"
I'M NOT READY TO GO DOWN
WITH THE SHIP OR THE TRAIN!
 YOU'RE BLUFFING.
" STICK AROUND FIVE MINUTES,"
AND YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHO'S BLUFFING.
"YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU LEFT ME,"
ZHU LI!
WHEN THEY WRITE
"THE HISTORY BOOKS,"
YOUR NAME WILL BE
SYNONYMOUS WITH BETRAYAL!
"PEOPLE WILL SAY, ""HEY,"
"WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT GUY?"""
"""OH, DIDN'T YOU HEAR,"
HE VARRICK'D HIMSELF BECAUSE
"SOME GIRL ZHU LI'D HIM!"""
ENOUGH.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'D LET YOU BLOW YOURSELF UP?
YOU'RE WORKING FOR KUVIRA.
YOU DON'T GET TO QUIT.
GRAB HIM.
YOU TRY TO PULL ME AWAY
"FROM THIS THING,"
AND I'LL HIT THIS REMOTE
AND BLOW IT IMMEDIATELY.
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A TIMER AND A REMOTE?
"WELL, FIRST I BUILT"
"THE TIMER, BUT THEN I THOUGHT,"
"""YOU COULD DRAG ME OFF THE TRAIN."""
SO THEN I BUILT A REMOTE.
"BUT THEN I THOUGHT, ""WELL, NOW,"
"""DO I REALLY NEED"
THE TIMER ANYMORE?
"""BECAUSE I GOT A REMOTE"
"IN MY""..."
WHATEVER!
I'M COVERING ALL MY BASES!
"THE POINT IS, YOU'RE LEAVING."
WE'RE STAYING.
YOU HAVE TO GO
INTO THE AVATAR STATE!
DO IT!
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE GOT THE POISON OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
 I KNEW YOU WERE WEAK.
YOU BROKE OUR AGREEMENT!
ATTACK!
KEEP THEM BACK!
I'M CALLING FOR HELP.
" STUNNING WORK, IKKI."
IT HURTS MY EYES
WITH ITS RAW EMOTIONAL POWER.
"AH, PEDESTRIAN."
I ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU
LOOK LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE.
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME
THE INNER MEELO.
 HELP!
YOU HAVE TO GET KORRA
AND THE REST OF US
OUT OF HERE NOW! HURRY!
FINALLY! LET'S GET IT ON!
THIS IS EVERYONE. OUR HALF
OF THE TRAIN IS CLEAR.
THAT'S GOOD.
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.
 YOU'RE INSANE.
YOU KNEW THAT WHEN YOU HIRED ME.
"BOLIN, DO THE THING."
 UH...
 UNHOOK THE CARS!
"OH, COME ON,"
THAT WAS AN EASY ONE!
" MAN, THAT WAS GREAT."
"I GOTTA ADMIT, YOU HAD ME"
GOING THERE FOR A WHILE.
I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO BLOW US UP.
"NOW, HOW DO WE"
TURN THIS THING OFF?
"OH, WE CAN'T TURN IT OFF."
WE'RE GOING TO BLOW UP.
"BUT WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD RUN,"
RIGHT?
"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,"
A GOOD RUN?
I'M STILL RUNNING!
I LIKE RUNNING!
I'LL SEE YOU
"ON THE OTHER SIDE, ZHU LI."
"I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I HATE YOU."
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE ACTUALLY BLEW HIMSELF UP.
THAT MAN WAS CRAZIER THAN
A SEWER-PIPE ELEPHANT RAT.
LET'S GET BACK TO ZAOFU.
"YES! YOU DID IT, BOLIN."
YOU DID THE THING.
MWAH!
 I CAN'T BELIEVE
ZHU LI WORKED FOR YOU
AS LONG AS SHE DID.
"DIVE, PEPPER! DIVE!"
HERE COMES A HURRICANE!
YOU CAN'T HANDLE ALL THIS MEELO!
WE'VE GOT HER! GO!
 WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM!
" OPAL, GET OUT OF HERE!"
WE'LL BE FINE!
JUST GO!
I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU!
I LOVE YOU!
 ZAOFU IS OURS!
BRING THE CITIZENS OF ZAOFU
TO KNEEL
BEFORE THE GREAT UNITER.
ALL WHO PLEDGE THEIR LOYALTY
TO ME
WILL KEEP THEIR FREEDOM
AND BE DEALT WITH FAIRLY
AS FULL CITIZENS
OF THE EARTH EMPIRE.
THE REST WILL BE IMPRISONED
"AS TRAITORS,"
LIKE SU BEIFONG AND HER SONS.
NOW BOW.
BOW TO HER! DO IT!
SHE IS YOUR RIGHTFUL LEADER!
"I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU,"
JUNIOR.
 TAKE THEM AWAY!
 GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.
YOU'RE CRUSHING
MY INDIVIDUALITY.
 ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER!
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO WAY
THEY SURVIVED?
"POSITIVE, BUT I THINK"
I CAN REPLICATE HIS WORK
WITH THE SPIRIT VINES
AND GET US BACK ON TRACK.
I'LL JUST NEED AN ASSISTANT.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HELP BAATAR BUILD
THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN?
"IT WOULD BE MY HONOR,"
GREAT UNITER.
BEGIN DISMANTLING THE DOMES.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
KUVIRA HAS DEFEATED THE AVATAR
AND NOW CONTROLS
THE ENTIRE EARTH EMPIRE.
"LUCKILY, THE AIRBENDER KIDS"
AND OPAL RESCUED KORRA
AND ESCAPED ZAOFU.
"FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS,"
KORRA WILL FINALLY BE BACK
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
"MEANWHILE, VARRICK AND BOLIN ESCAPED"
FROM BAATAR JR. AND ARE ON THE RUN.
BUT WILL THEY MAKE IT
BACK TO THE CITY IN TIME
TO WARN EVERYONE ABOUT KUVIRA'S
NEW SPIRIT ENERGY SUPER WEAPON?
NAGA!
"I MISSED YOU SO MUCH, GIRL."
MOM! DAD! WE'RE BACK!
AND WE GOT KORRA!
"WELL, AREN'T YOU A SIGHT"
FOR SORE EYES.
BUM-JU AND I SURE MISSED YOU.
"IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, BUMI."
"AND YOU TOO, BUM-JU."
"WELL DONE, KIDS."
I'M PROUD OF YOU ALL
FOR FINDING KORRA.
PROUD ENOUGH TO GET ME MY TATS?
NO.
WELCOME HOME.
"I MISSED YOU, TENZIN."
"NOW, I HATE TO GET RIGHT DOWN"
"TO BUSINESS,"
BUT I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED IN ZAOFU.
WAY TO RUIN THE MOMENT.
KUVIRA'S WHOLE ARMY WAS THERE.
"SHE CAPTURED MOM, DAD,"
AND MY BROTHERS.
I THOUGHT I WAS STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP HER.
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE.
NO ONE EXPECTED YOU
TO HANDLE KUVIRA ON YOUR OWN.
IT'S UP TO ALL OF US TO FIND
A WAY TO DEAL WITH HER.
WE'RE JUST GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
WHERE'S BOLIN?
"HE'S NOT STILL ON KUVIRA'S SIDE, IS HE?"
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD STAY WITH HER
AFTER WHAT SHE DID TO MY FAMILY.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
HOW ABOUT YOU USE
YOUR OWN LEGS FOR A WHILE?
"YOU KNOW, WHEN I FLED"
"REPUBLIC CITY WITH ZHU LI,"
SHE CARRIED ME 20 MILES IN ONE DAY.
AND THAT WAS AFTER
SHE SPRAINED HER ANKLE.
"WELL, ZHU LI'S NOT HERE, OKAY?"
THAT'S FINE.
LEAVE ME HERE.
LET THE WORMS GOBBLE ME UP.
 I DESERVE IT.
" NO WAY, MISTER."
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OFF THAT EASILY.
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
"WEAPON KUVIRA'S TRYING TO MAKE,"
"WHICH, MAY I REMIND YOU,"
COULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE.
"NO, DON'T REMIND ME! I KNOW, I'M A"
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PERSON."
"OKAY, LOOK,"
KUVIRA FOOLED US BOTH
INTO DOING HER DIRTY WORK
AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT EITHER.
BUT YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA
MAKE IT UP TO THE WORLD?
BY GETTING BACK TO REPUBLIC CITY
AND WARNING EVERYONE
WHAT SHE'S UP TO.
"SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE MY HAND,"
AND MARCH WITH ME OUT OF THIS FOREST!
YOU REALLY HAVE A WAY
"WITH WORDS, KID."
NO WONDER I MADE YOU A MOVER STAR.
"ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE"
THE DRIVER'S SEAT FOR A WHILE. HOP ON.
GREAT.
MY FEET COULD USE A BREAK.
"OKAY. OH, BOY. HERE WE GO."
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WAITING LONG.
ONLY THREE YEARS.
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YOU TOO.
AND I'M LOVING THE HAIR.
THANKS. YOU'RE LOOKING
SNAZZY AS ALWAYS.
"COME ON, MAKO GOT US"
A TABLE AT THE RESTAURANT.
 KORRA!
" HI, MAKO."
"HELLO THERE, PRINCE WU,"
"RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE THRONE,"
AND THIS GUY'S BOSS.
I BET HE'S TOLD YOU
A LOT ABOUT ME.
NOPE. NOT A THING.
THEN WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THE FOOD HERE.
I KNOW THE CHEF PERSONALLY.
LET'S START WITH A ROUND OF
YOUR SPICY OCTOPUS FRITTERS.
AND KEEP THE
CUCUMBER-ALOE WATER FLOWING.
GOT TO KEEP THIS
PRINCELY SKIN HYDRATED.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST
GOING TO BE THE THREE OF US.
"SORRY, I COULDN'T DITCH HIM."
BUT HE PROMISED TO BE ON
HIS BEST BEHAVIOR.
"HEY, POP INTO THE AVATAR STATE"
FOR ME. I WANT TO SEE YOUR EYES GLOW.
WHAT? NO.
SO CAN YOU GO INTO
THE AVATAR STATE AGAIN?
I WAS WORRIED WHEN YOU TOLD ME
YOU COULDN'T.
WAIT.
WHEN DID SHE TELL YOU SHE COULDN'T?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO?
I WROTE TO ASAMI WHILE I WAS AWAY.
I ASKED HER NOT TO TELL YOU. I'M SORRY.
"WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER"
WRITE TO ME? OR BOLIN?
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
"A ""HELLO"" WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE."
"MAKO, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY"
"BETTER, SHE DIDN'T WRITE ME EITHER."
WHY WOULD SHE...
NEVER MIND.
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T STAY
"IN TOUCH, BUT I'M BACK NOW."
AND I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH YOU TWO.
"WELL, I KIND OF HAVE SOME BIG NEWS."
I WENT TO VISIT MY FATHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
HE'D BEEN WRITING ME LETTERS
AND I GUESS I FINALLY FELT READY
TO TRY AND FORGIVE HIM.
YOU SURE YOU CAN TRUST HIM?
HE MIGHT JUST BE
MANIPULATING YOU AGAIN.
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MY OWN FATHER IS CAPABLE OF?
"NO. NO, I DIDN'T MEAN..."
YOU DON'T GET TO DISAPPEAR
FOR THREE YEARS
AND THEN ACT LIKE YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.
IT'S NOT LIKE I PLANNED
TO BE GONE THAT LONG.
"I WANTED TO COME BACK, BUT I"
NEVER FELT READY UNTIL NOW.
AS MUCH AS I'M ENJOYING
"THIS LITTLE CATCH-UP,"
MY ROYAL BLADDER
IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE.
"MAKO? COME ON,"
I NEED YOU TO STAND GUARD.
I'M NOT GONNA HOLD YOUR HAND
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE
TO EMPTY YOUR ROYAL BLADDER.
GO TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR OWN
FOR ONCE.
FINE.
DO YOU ALWAYS GO
TO THE BATHROOM WITH HIM?
"I DON'T GO ""WITH HIM"" WITH HIM."
I JUST STAND THERE IN THE
GENERAL VICINITY WHILE HE...
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
"GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR."
PERHAPS A SPRITZ OF COLOGNE
TO FRESHEN UP?
"MAKE IT A DOUBLE, BUDDY."
"MAKO, HELP!"
WU DOWN.
WU DOWN.
I WISH PABU WERE HERE.
HE COULD JUST CHEW US OUT OF THIS.
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS INCISORS
SHARP AS A KNIFE?
ZHU LI.
"WELL, LOOK WHAT WE CAUGHT."
WONDER IF THEY WERE
TRACKING US AFTER WE ESCAPED.
"HELLO, FELLOW TRAVELERS!"
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD
HELP US OUT OF THIS NET?
WHY WOULD WE FREE A COUPLE OF
LOWLY EARTH EMPIRE SOLDIERS?
 LOWLY?
WE WERE PART OF KUVIRA'S INNER CIRCLE!
WERE! NOT ANYMORE. WE JUMPED
SHIP. PLEASE JUST LET US OUT.
I THINK I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO
WITH A COUPLE OF KUVIRA'S TOP MEN.
I WONDER WHAT'S TAKING WU SO LONG.
HE'S NOT ONE TO MISS OUT ON
LUNCH. I'LL GO CHECK ON HIM.
"WU, YOU IN HERE?"
"COME ON, YOUR OCTOPUS FRITTERS"
ARE GETTING COLD.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
"EXCUSE ME, DID YOU HAPPEN"
TO SEE IF PRINCE WU CAME OUT THIS WAY?
"SORRY, MISS. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM."
HMM. I'M IN LAUNDRY.
AH!
"THEY'VE GOT WU! GET THE CAR,"
I'M GOING AFTER THEM.
GET IN.
WE'RE LOSING THEM.
HANG A RIGHT AT THE NEXT BLOCK.
WE CAN CUT THEM OFF ON SEVENTH.
YOU MISSED THE TURN!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I KNOW THESE STREETS BETTER THAN YOU.
I BUILT SOME OF THEM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SIT DOWN.
WHERE IS HE?
WHOA!
WU'S NOT HERE. THIS GUY WAS THE ONLY
ONE IN THE TRUCK.
WHERE'S THE PRINCE?
HALFWAY TO KUVIRA BY NOW.
ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER.
THEY MUST HAVE MOVED WU
TO A DIFFERENT VEHICLE
WHEN WE LOST SIGHT OF THEM.
TAKE THIS GUY IN FOR BOOKING.
CHARGE HIM WITH KIDNAPPING.
AND TELL CHIEF BEIFONG
THAT PRINCE WU IS MISSING.
PUT OUT AN ALL-POINTS
BULLETIN. WE'LL KEEP LOOKING.
WHERE DO WE START?
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CARS
IN THE CITY
AND HE COULD BE IN ANY ONE OF THEM.
OR THEY MIGHT TRY SMUGGLING
HIM OUT ON AN AIRSHIP.
OR MAYBE A BOAT.
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE!
THE ONE TIME I DON'T WATCH HIM
PEE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
THEY'RE TAKING WU
TO THE TRAIN STATION!
ARE YOU SURE? HOW DO YOU KNOW?
"I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY, JUST DRIVE!"
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME!
SO HOW DID A BUNCH
OF WATER AND FIRE BENDERS
END UP IN ONE OF KUVIRA'S
REEDUCATION CAMPS?
CALL IT WHAT IT IS. A PRISON.
KUVIRA'S BEEN PURGING STATES
OF ANYONE
WHO'S NOT OF EARTH KINGDOM ORIGIN
AND LOCKING THEM UP.
PURGING?
WHAT ARE YOU ACTING
SO SURPRISED FOR?
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN
"WHAT SHE WAS UP TO,"
BEING PART OF
"HER ""INNER CIRCLE"" AND ALL."
"NO, I SWEAR. AND THE INNER CIRCLE"
"THING LASTED, LIKE, LESS THAN A DAY."
WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL US
WHERE YOU'RE TAKING US?
THE BORDER CHECKPOINT.
YOU'RE GONNA HELP US TALK OUR WAY
PAST SOME EARTH EMPIRE SOLDIERS.
"AND ONCE WE'RE THROUGH,"
WE'LL SEE ABOUT LETTING YOU GO.
LAVA TIME!
BET YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT!
"LOOK, I'M SORRY FOR"
"WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF YOU,"
"BUT AS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN,"
WE DON'T WORK FOR KUVIRA ANYMORE.
"YEAH, IF OUR HANDSOME MUGS"
GET RECOGNIZED
TRYING TO GO THROUGH
"THAT CHECKPOINT,"
WE'RE GONERS!
"IF YOU REALLY ARE FUGITIVES,"
YOU BETTER LISTEN UP.
WE'VE BEEN SCOUTING
THIS REGION FOR DAYS.
THERE'S A WALL STRETCHING
ALONG THE ENTIRE BORDER
AND PATROLS GUARDING
EVERY PART OF IT.
THAT CHECKPOINT IS OUR ONLY WAY OUT.
"IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK, BARAZ."
HOW DO WE KNOW
THEY WON'T TURN US IN?
"IF HE WANTED US GONE, WE'D BE AT THE"
BOTTOM OF A POOL OF LAVA RIGHT NOW.
IF ANY OF US WANT TO GET OUT
"OF THE EARTH EMPIRE ALIVE,"
WE'LL HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER.
"ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S THIS CHECKPOINT?"
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE WU IS
JUST BY TOUCHING SOME SPIRIT VINES?
I LEARNED HOW TO CONNECT TO
PEOPLE'S ENERGY THROUGH THEM.
WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT?
LIN'S MOM.
I FOUND HER IN THE SWAMP. THAT PLACE IS
LIKE ONE GIANT SPIRIT WILD.
YOU MET TOPH?
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?
"A CRANKY, MORE MISERABLE"
VERSION OF LIN.
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
WHICH TRAIN IS WU ON?
I DON'T KNOW!
SPLIT UP AND START LOOKING.
FOLLOW MY LEAD.
"GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR."
CAN WE HELP YOU?
YOU SURE CAN. WE CAPTURED THESE
ESCAPED PRISONERS.
WE NEED TO GET THEM
TO A SECURE FACILITY.
 WHERE'D THEY ESCAPE FROM?
 CAMP 14.
THEN WHY ARE YOU BRINGING
THEM THROUGH HERE?
CAMP 14'S BACK THE OTHER WAY.
YOU THINK WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE CAMP 14 IS?
KUVIRA WANTS THEM TRANSFERRED.
THEN I'LL NEED TO SEE
THE TRANSFER ORDER.
"LISTEN, PAL, I HAD TO FIGHT"
"OFF 2 BADGER-MOLES,"
"6 WOLF-BATS, AND 18"
HOG-MONKEYS TO GET THESE GUYS.
SO SORRY IF I DON'T HAVE
THE PAPERWORK.
I WAS TOO BUSY CRAMMING IT IN
A HOG-MONKEY'S MOUTH
WHILE IT WAS TRYING TO EAT ME.
I AM IN SORE NEED OF A SHOWER
AND I HAVE BLISTERS
THAT ARE THE SIZE OF CANTALOUPES
AND TWICE AS JUICY!
"SO YOU CAN LET US THROUGH,"
OR YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR NAME
AND RANK AND I'LL PASS IT ON TO KUVIRA.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLDIERS
"WHO QUESTION HER ORDERS, DON'T YOU?"
BAD STUFF!
LET THEM THROUGH!
WAIT! STOP THEM!
THEY'RE TRAITORS TO THE EMPIRE!
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GOING BACK TO PRISON!
AH. AH! AH!
AH!
 AH!
"BOY, I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS."
I STILL GOT THAT VARRICK TOUCH.
WE'RE CLEAR. COME ON!
"VARRICK, WAIT!"
WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM.
AH!
RETREAT!
THANKS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK.
"YEAH, I KIND OF DID. LET'S GO."
THE 4:15 BOUND FOR OMASHU
IS NOW LEAVING
ON TRACK NUMBER SIX. ALL ABOARD!
"IF WE DON'T FIND WU SOON,"
WE MIGHT NEVER FIND HIM.
HE'S ON THAT TRAIN!
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE HE'S HERE?
"I DON'T. BUT I HAD A FEELING, OKAY?"
AND I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO TRUST
"YOUR ""AVATAR FEELINGS""?"
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
IF YOU HAD GUARDED THE PRINCE
LIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO.
"OH, SO IT'S MY FAULT WU DISAPPEARED."
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MINE!
"GUYS, SHH."
LISTEN.
"WU! WU, IT'S ME."
MAKO? WHERE AM I?
 AM I DEAD?
" NO, YOU'RE ON A TRAIN."
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
EVERYONE OUT.
I'M NOT GOING UP THERE.
AH!
AH!
AH!
JUMP!
 YOU ALL RIGHT?
 YES!
"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,"
"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,"
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
"GETTING A RAISE, BUDDY."
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING KORRA.
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND YOU
WITHOUT HER.
"I OWE YOU MY LIFE, AVATAR."
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY
TO REPAY YOU.
"OOH, I KNOW. HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU"
OUT FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN?
REALLY? YOU'RE ASKING ME
OUT RIGHT NOW?
"SO I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR A ""MAYBE""?"
HOW ABOUT A NEVER?
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I IMAGINED
FOR OUR FIRST DAY BACK TOGETHER.
BUT IT WAS KIND OF LIKE OLD TIMES.
EXCEPT FOR THE GETTING ON EACH
OTHER'S NERVES PART.
"ACTUALLY, THAT IS LIKE"
OLD TIMES FOR ME AND KORRA.
I'M SORRY THINGS GOT SO TENSE EARLIER.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GUESS AFTER BEING APART
"FOR THREE YEARS,"
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A BIT
OF AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD.
"YEAH, BUT IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK."
THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE I'D RATHER BE.
HMM.
YOU GUYS ARE THE GREATEST
FRIENDS A GUY COULD HAVE.
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH HIM?
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO TAKE HIM
BACK TO THE HOTEL.
WHOO. YOU'RE TELLING ME!
I NEED A CUSHY SAFE HOUSE SOMEWHERE.
I THINK I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.
"NICE DIGS, MAKO."
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU CAME FROM MONEY.
I DON'T. THIS IS ASAMI'S PLACE.
SHE WAS NICE ENOUGH TO LET MY FAMILY
STAY HERE AFTER THEY FLED BA SING SE.
MAKO! IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO...
ARE YOU...
"GRANDMA, THIS IS PRINCE WU."
HE NEEDS TO STAY WITH YOU AND
THE FAMILY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
"IT'S AN HONOR, GRANDMA MAKO."
SHE LOVES ROYALTY.
I THINK I'LL FIT RIGHT IN HERE.
"THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME, MAKO."
NOW WHERE'S THE NEAREST BATHROOM? I
HAVE BEEN HOLDING IT ALL DAY!
I KNOW IT MIGHT NOT MEAN MUCH COMING
"FROM A GUY WEARING THIS UNIFORM,"
BUT I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT KUVIRA'S PUT YOU THROUGH.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
GUESS THIS IS WHERE WE PART WAYS.
IT'S BEEN A BLAST!
WE'RE HEADING NORTH TOO.
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH US?
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO
AFTER YOU SAVED OUR NECKS.
"ON THAT HUNK OF JUNK? NO, THANKS."
I'M ALLERGIC TO DROWNING.
"OOF! I MEAN, UH, WE'D LOVE A LIFT!"
EW. UH.
THIS AREA IS OVERRUN WITH SPIRIT VINES
AND THEY APPEAR TO BE
EVEN MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE SAMPLES WE TOOK
FROM REPUBLIC CITY.
PERFECT.
HARVEST THESE VINES
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
AVATAR KORRA IS BACK
"AND YOURS TRULY, SHIRO SHINOBI,"
COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED.
IT'S BEEN MY HONOR
TO BRING YOU NEWS
OF KORRA AND HER FRIENDS
OVER THE YEARS.
SO MANY HEART-POUNDING MOMENTS!
WHO CAN FORGET AMON
AND HIS EQUALIST REVOLUTION?
I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES!
THEN THERE WAS THAT TIME
I COVERED THE NUKTUK
MOVER PREMIERE.
"BOY, WAS THAT FUN."
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.
"SIT BACK, RELAX,"
AND TAKE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.
"YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING"
ABOUT BEING KIDNAPPED
THAT MAKES A GUY REALIZE HE
NEEDS TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER.
" YEAH, I AGREE."
LET'S TOUGHEN YOU UP.
AHH! I WASN'T READY!
WU DOWN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
"MAKO, HOW DARE YOU INJURE"
THE PRINCE?
WOULD HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS LIKE
A CHERRY-BERRY LEMONADE?
AND MAYBE SOME OF THOSE
STICKY DUMPLINGS TOO?
 LOOK AT YOU.
"YOU'RE SO WEAK, ""WU DOWN"""
IS YOUR CATCHPHRASE.
" I KNOW, I'M A WIMP."
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
I WAS BORN THAT WAY.
"I'M NOT LIKE YOU, MAKO."
I WASN'T RAISED BY
A PACK OF COPS IN THE WOODS.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
"ABOUT ME, DO YOU?"
"YEAH, I'M DRAWING A BLANK."
WHY IS THAT?
HOW DO I NOT KNOW STUFF
ABOUT YOU?
UH... YOU NEVER ASKED?
" WELL, I'M ASKING NOW."
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?
IS THERE A SPECIAL LADY
IN YOUR LIFE?
NOT SINCE KORRA AND I BROKE UP.
WHAT? YOU DATED THE AVATAR? SIT.
YOU AND I NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE GAB SESSION RIGHT NOW.
HOW'D YOU GUYS FIRST MEET?
BOLIN AND I WERE PLAYING
FOR THE FIRE FERRETS.
 YOU WERE A PRO-BENDER?
YES.
WILL YOU JUST LET ME
TELL THE STORY?
 CARRY ON.
"BOLIN AND I GREW UP DIRT POOR,"
"SO ONCE I BECAME A PRO-BENDER,"
I WANTED IT ALL:
"RICHES, FAME, ACCOLADES."
BUT ALL THAT CHANGED
WHEN I MET KORRA.
COME HERE.
"I WANT YOU MEET MY BROTHER,"
MAKO.
 MAKO?
"WOW, I HEARD YOU PLAY"
ON THE RADIO.
" COME ON, BOLIN, WE'RE UP."
"WHOA, THAT WAS THE"
FIRST TIME YOU MET?
"KIND OF RUDE THERE, BUDDY."
KNOW WHAT ELSE IS RUDE?
INTERRUPTING.
KORRA PROVED TO BE
"AN AMAZING PRO-BENDER,"
AND A LOYAL FRIEND.
SHE HELPED ME SAVE BOLIN WHEN
HE WAS TAKEN BY THE EQUALISTS.
AFTER GOING THROUGH
"SUCH A CRAZY EXPERIENCE,"
I FELT LIKE KORRA AND I
HAD A POWERFUL CONNECTION.
SO THEN YOU SMOOCHED HER
REAL GOOD?
HUH? HUH?
 NOT EXACTLY.
AH!
"OH, NO. I'M SO SORRY."
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.
 HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE ME?
"I MEAN, I WAS JU..."
I WAS... I-I... WOW.
THAT WAS...
 WAIT.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING
YOU SAID TO ASAMI?
YOU REALLY GOT TO WORK ON
YOUR INTRODUCTIONS.
"HEY, WHEN YOU GOT CHARM"
"LIKE MINE,"
YOU DON'T NEED INTRODUCTIONS.
HANGING OUT WITH ASAMI
"WAS AWESOME,"
BUT IT MADE THINGS
WITH KORRA... COMPLICATED.
SO I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD
SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER.
"LOOK, I REALLY LIKE YOU"
AND I THINK WE WERE MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER.
"KORRA, I'M REALLY SORRY BUT..."
I JUST DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT YOU.
" THAT'S HARSH, MAKO."
"I KNOW, AND THE WORST PART"
"ABOUT IT IS,"
IT WASN'T TOTALLY TRUE.
WE NEED TO TALK.
 SAVE YOUR BREATH.
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.
" NO, I HAVEN'T."
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS...
"AS MUCH AS YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY,"
I ALSO THINK
YOU'RE PRETTY AMAZING.
 HOT DOG!
"SMOOCH CITY, HERE WE COME."
YOU PLAYER.
WHOA.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DATING ASAMI.
" TU, GET OUT OF HERE!"
NAUGHTY MAKO.
YOU TAKE AFTER YOUR GRANDFATHER.
" GUYS, GRANDMA,"
EVERYTHING WASN'T SO CUT
AND DRY.
I WASN'T DATING ASAMI.
 DENIAL.
"OKAY, MAYBE I WAS DATING HER."
IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING.
BUT MY FEELINGS FOR KORRA
BECAME CLEAR
WHEN TARRLOK CAPTURED HER.
IT FELT LIKE A PIECE OF ME
WAS GONE.
I WAS SO WORRIED.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
 I'M FINE.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
OOF. I BET ASAMI WASN'T
TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
I'VE NOTICED
HOW YOU TREAT KORRA...
HOW YOU ACTED
WHEN SHE WAS MISSING.
"YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER,"
DON'T YOU?
 THINGS ARE CRAZY RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE DEAL WITH OUR
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS LATER?
"WELL, THERE MIGHT NOT BE"
ANY RELATIONSHIP
TO WORRY ABOUT LATER.
 ASAMI!
 OUCH.
YUP. TURNS OUT SHE WAS RIGHT.
IT WAS TIME TO MAN UP
AND CALL IT QUITS.
"ASAMI,"
I'M SORRY THINGS GOT
SO MESSED UP BETWEEN US.
"BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY,"
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.
 I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO.
"WAIT, WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE"
YOU BREAKING UP WITH HER?
YES. THAT WAS A BREAKUP.
 DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A BREAKUP.
IT WAS MUTUAL.
WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.
WE BOTH KNEW...
CAN I JUST GET ON WITH
THE REST OF MY STORY OR WHAT?
 FINE.
BUT I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
AS AMBIGUOUS WITH KORRA
AS YOU WERE WITH ASAMI.
"TRUST ME, I WASN'T."
KORRA AND I ENDED UP
STOPPING AMON TOGETHER
"AND AFTER THAT, I WAS FINALLY"
ABLE TO TELL HER HOW I FELT.
EXACTLY HOW I FELT.
"I LOVE YOU, KORRA."
 I LOVE YOU TOO.
 AWW.
AND THEN YOU TWO LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER?
 UM...
TENZIN'S JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU
BECOME THE BEST AVATAR
YOU CAN BE.
 OF COURSE YOU TAKE HIS SIDE.
 I'M NOT TAKING HIS SIDE.
"YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I WONDER"
WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE ON.
 THERE AREN'T ANY SIDES!
 HOW COULD YOU TAKE HIS SIDE?
 WHAT'S WITH YOU AND SIDES?
" WELL, EXCUSE ME, OFFICER!"
DON'T LET ME STAND IN THE WAY
OF YOU WRITING TICKETS.
I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAVE THE WORLD!
"WELL, I GUESS IF WE'RE"
"BOTH PUTTING OUR JOBS FIRST,"
MAYBE THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP.
" SO, WHAT?"
ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH ME?
YEAH. I GUESS I AM.
 NOW THAT'S A BREAKUP!
"AFTER THAT, I DOVE INTO MY WORK."
SOMEONE HAD BEEN TAKING OUT
SUPPLY SHIPS
HEADING TO THE SOUTHERN WATER
TRIBE.
ASAMI'S COMPANY
"WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS,"
SO SHE AND I WORKED TOGETHER
TO CATCH THE PERPS.
THE STAKEOUT WAS THE PERFECT
WAY TO GET MY MIND OFF KORRA.
IT WAS AN INTENSE NIGHT.
ASAMI AND I DISCOVERED THE
TRIADS HAD DOUBLE CROSSED US.
"WE BARELY GOT AWAY,"
BUT BY THEN ASAMI'S WAREHOUSE
HAD BEEN CLEARED OUT.
MY COMPANY... IT'S OVER.
I GIVE UP.
"WELL, I'M NOT GIVING UP ON YOU."
"I KNOW, I KNOW. DON'T TELL ME."
I HAD NO RIGHT KISSING ASAMI.
"NO, ACTUALLY,"
I'M COMPLETELY FINE WITH THAT.
YOU OFFICIALLY BROKE UP
WITH KORRA
"AND THEREFORE, YOU'RE FREE TO"
SMOOCH WHOEVER YOU WISH.
IF ONLY IT HAD BEEN THAT SIMPLE.
"MAKO, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!"
"KORRA, HEY, I MISSED YOU TOO."
SO YOU'RE NOT STILL MAD AT ME?
WE HAD THAT FIGHT
"BEFORE YOU LEFT, REMEMBER?"
 NOT REALLY.
I GOT ATTACKED BY A DARK SPIRIT
AND I LOST MY MEMORY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
MAYBE IT HASN'T ALL
COME BACK YET.
WAS IT A BAD FIGHT?
 AHH...
HMM... NO.
NO. IT WASN'T THAT BAD.
" WHOA, WHOA, WHOA."
"SO YOU WERE BACK WITH ASAMI,"
BUT THEN KORRA CAME BACK
AND THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE STILL TOGETHER
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
YOU WEREN'T?
 JUST LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER.
"WELL, ME AND ASAMI WERE"
NEVER OFFICIALLY BACK TOGETHER.
REALLY? THAT AGAIN?
"YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE"
SO AFRAID TO DISAPPOINT ANYONE
THAT YOU END UP
DISAPPOINTING EVERYONE.
TRUER WORDS
HAVE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN.
HIGH FIVE!
"WELL, EVENTUALLY,"
I DID TELL KORRA
BUT BY THEN SHE ALREADY KNEW.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
THE TRUTH IN THE FIRST PLACE?
"I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE, BUT..."
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN.
I GUESS PART OF ME WANTED TO
FORGET ABOUT THE BREAKUP TOO.
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT THIS...
US... DOESN'T WORK.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 IT'S OVER.
FOR REAL THIS TIME.
"AFTER HARMONIC CONVERGENCE,"
THE WORLD CHANGED.
TEAM AVATAR TRAVELED AROUND
SEARCHING FOR NEW AIRBENDERS.
"AT FIRST, IT WAS AWKWARD"
BEING AROUND KORRA AND ASAMI.
AS YOU WERE.
LADIES.
BUT THEN I REALIZED
I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHO I WAS
WITHOUT A LADY IN MY LIFE.
 I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
"I MEAN, TO NEED DISTANCE"
"FROM WOMEN,"
BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY
"ALL OVER ME,"
ALL THE TIME.
" ANYWAY,"
I EVENTUALLY HELPED KORRA
DEFEAT ZAHEER
"AND SAVE THE AIRBENDERS,"
AND WE DID IT AS FRIENDS.
KORRA SHOWED ME THE IMPORTANCE
OF PUTTING OTHERS BEFORE MYSELF.
"AND WHENEVER I THINK OF HER,"
SHE CONTINUES TO INSPIRE ME.
 WOW.
THAT STORY IS AMAZING
AND I REALLY LEARNED SOMETHING.
YOU DID? GOOD.
"YEAH, I LEARNED THAT I REALLY"
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.
CRAZY!
"ALSO, I REALIZED"
THAT LADIES ARE COMPLICATED.
"NO OFFENSE, GRANDMA."
 NONE TAKEN.
I BETTER JUST FOCUS ON
BEING A BETTER KING.
"OKAY, COME AT ME."
I CAN TAKE IT.
AH! WU DOWN!
 I BROUGHT YOU SOME TEA.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE COLD
OUT HERE.
 YOU'RE SO SWEET.
THANKS.
 ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM OUT OF SORTS.
 SORRY.
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING TOPH SAID.
SHE TOLD ME THAT THE WORLD
DOESN'T NEED ME
AND IT'S BASICALLY POINTLESS
TO TRY TO STOP KUVIRA.
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
"AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT SO TOO."
I FIGURED SHE WAS JUST BEING
"HER NORMAL, CRANKY SELF,"
BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
SHE HAD A POINT.
" NO, SHE DOESN'T."
THE WORLD DOES NEED YOU.
YOU'RE THE AVATAR.
" BUT NO MATTER WHAT I DO,"
THE WORLD SEEMS TO ALWAYS
BE OUT OF BALANCE.
"GROWING UP, I COULDN'T WAIT"
TO BE THE AVATAR.
I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY
GONNA CHANGE THINGS.
I WAS SO NAIVE.
THE FIRST TIME I SAW AMON
"TAKE SOMEONE'S BENDING AWAY,"
I WAS TERRIFIED.
 YOUR FIREBENDING IS GONE.
FOREVER.
THEN MY WORST NIGHTMARE
CAME TRUE.
 KORRA!
 NO!
I TOLD YOU I WOULD DESTROY YOU.
"KORRA, YOU'RE FORGETTING"
ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU EXPOSED AMON
AS THE FRAUD HE WAS.
THE EQUALIST MOVEMENT
LOST ITS LEADER AND ITS POWER.
FREE ELECTIONS WERE HELD
IN THE UNITED REPUBLIC
AND NON-BENDERS
FINALLY HAD A VOICE.
PEOPLE HAD HOPE AGAIN
AND IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.
 AND I WAS HOPEFUL TOO.
BUT THAT FEELING
DIDN'T LAST LONG.
"AS SOON AS I DEFEATED AMON,"
A NEW ENEMY TOOK HIS PLACE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TRUSTED YOU.
YOU MADE ME THINK
YOU WANTED TO RESTORE BALANCE
"WITH THE SPIRITS,"
BUT THIS... THIS ISN'T BALANCE.
IT'S MADNESS!
NOW LET HER GO.
IF YOU WANT YOUR FRIEND
"TO MAKE IT OUT OF THE SPIRIT WORLD,"
YOU'LL OPEN THE OTHER PORTAL
NOW.
"BECAUSE OF UNALAQ,"
"I BETRAYED TENZIN,"
"OPENED THE PORTALS,"
AND THREW THE SPIRIT
AND HUMAN WORLDS INTO CHAOS.
IT WAS MY FAULT HE FUSED
WITH VAATU AND BECAME A DARK AVATAR.
AND I WAS HELPLESS TO STOP HIM
FROM DESTROYING RAAVA
AND CUTTING OFF MY CONNECTION
TO MY PAST LIVES.
"WITH RAAVA GONE,"
UNALAQ AND VAATU BECAME MORE
POWERFUL THAN EVER.
BUT YOU BECAME
MORE POWERFUL TOO.
"I MEAN, YOU TURNED INTO"
A GIANT SPIRIT.
"YEAH, THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME."
AND OPENING THE SPIRIT PORTALS
TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD THING.
YOU BROUGHT BACK THE AIRBENDERS
AND CAUSED A POSITIVE SHIFT
IN THE WORLD.
"YES, BUT ZAHEER GOT"
"AIRBENDING TOO,"
AND NEARLY KILLED ME.
"IF IT WEREN'T FOR ZAHEER,"
THE EARTH QUEEN
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
"NO CRISIS IN THE EARTH KINGDOM,"
AND KUVIRA WOULDN'T BE IN POWER.
THINGS ARE MORE OUT OF BALANCE
THAN EVER NOW.
NOTHING'S CHANGED!
" YOU'RE RIGHT, KORRA."
 I AM?
 SHE IS?
"IT'S TRUE, THERE WILL ALWAYS"
BE NEW CONFLICTS
AND ENEMIES TO FACE.
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO LEARN FROM YOUR ENEMIES
"AND BETTER YOURSELF OVER TIME,"
WHICH YOU HAVE.
YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH
SINCE YOU FIRST ARRIVED
ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.
"WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE,"
YOU WERE HOTHEADED
AND A BIT SELFISH.
BUT YOU'VE MATURED INTO
A THOUGHTFUL YOUNG WOMAN
WHO PUTS THE NEEDS OF OTHERS
BEFORE HERSELF.
THE NEW AIR NATION
IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT.
YOU SACRIFICED EVERYTHING
TO SAVE THEM.
YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION
TO THE WORLD.
 THANK YOU BOTH.
I KNOW THIS KUVIRA PROBLEM IS
ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.
"BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,"
"NO MATTER HOW CRAZY THINGS GET,"
I'LL ALWAYS TRY
TO RESTORE BALANCE.
AND THAT'S WHEN
I MADE A SOLEMN VOW
NEVER TO EAT BARK.ONION SOUP
AGAIN.
"BEEN SIX YEARS, FOUR MONTHS,"
AND 14 DAYS...
UGH. I CAN STILL TASTE IT.
DOES ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE
THROWING THEMSELVES OVERBOARD?
 NOT ME!
I'VE SPENT THE LAST FEW HOURS
TUNING OUT
ALL THESE INCREDIBLY
BORING STORIES...
 HEY!
ALL THE WHILE MENTALLY COMPOSING
THE MOST EXCITING TALE
"EVER TOLD,"
SOON TO BECOME
THE GREATEST MOVER EVER MADE!
I PRESENT TO YOU NOW:
"BOLIN, AS NUKTUK,"
HERO OF THE SOUTH...
TRADEMARK VARRIMOVERS
INTERNATIONAL...
IN THE INCREDIBLE
TRUE STORY OF BOLIN!
HERO OF THE WORLD!
"WAIT, AM I PLAYING NUKTUK,"
OR IS NUKTUK PLAYING ME?
 BOTH.
"IT'S YOUR TRUE STORY,"
BUT WE'LL CAPITALIZE
ON THE AUDIENCE
OF THE NUKTUK FRANCHISE.
DUH.
HOW CAN YOU CALL ME
THE HERO OF THE WORLD?
I LEFT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY
TO JOIN UP WITH A PSYCHOTIC
"DICTATOR WHO IMPRISONED ME,"
AND NOW I'M RUNNING BACK HOME
WITH MY TAIL BETWEEN MY LEGS.
" NYA, BA, BA, BA, BA."
YOU'RE EMPHASIZING
THE WRONG STORY BEATS.
LET ME TELL IT.
THE STORY OF BOLIN
BEGINS IN AN EXOTIC
PORT OF CALL.
"A WISE SAGE, THE RICHEST"
"MERCHANT IN THE WORLD,"
AND A HANDSOME DEVIL
ALL SIT ON A SINGLE PILLOW
IN THE LIVING ROOM
OF A LUXURY YACHT.
HOW DO THEY ALL FIT
ON ONE PILLOW?
OOH! GIANT PILLOW!
 WRONG!
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME MAN! ME!
I TRY TO TEACH A SWAMI
"THE POWER OF LEVITATION,"
BUT HE'S TOO STUPID
"TO UNDERSTAND IT,"
SO I KICK HIM OUT.
"""UPON WHOM CAN I BESTOW"
"MY AWESOME KNOWLEDGE?"""
I ASK MYSELF.
THEN IN WALKS NUKTUK
"WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE,"
"A GORGEOUS DAME ON HIS ARM,"
AND A SONG ON HIS LIPS.
HE BURSTS INTO A RAPTUROUS
MELODY...
WHERE CAN I FIND MY TEACHER?
" OH, COME ON!"
"I WASN'T SINGING,"
YOU WERE NOT LEVITATING.
"AND ASAMI IS JUST A FRIEND,"
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IF YOU WANT TO TELL
"MY TRUE STORY,"
YOU SHOULD START FROM
WHEN I MET KORRA.
SHE CAME TO THE BENDING ARENA
ONE FATEFUL NIGHT...
THIS PLACE IS EVEN MORE
AMAZING THAN I IMAGINED!
"NAME'S BOLIN, BY THE WAY."
 KORRA.
 BORING!
WHEN DOES THE SINGING START?
 THERE WASN'T ANY SINGING.
BOO!
" YOU'RE ONSCREEN TALENT, KID."
LEAVE THE STORYTELLING
TO THE MASTERS.
SO THE TROUBLE BEGINS
WHEN THE AVATAR
IS TRAPPED IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
THE WORLD'S MOST EVIL VILLAINS
REALIZE
"THAT WITH KORRA OUT OF THE WAY,"
THE TIME IS RIGHT
TO TRY TO TAKE OUT BOLIN.
SO THE WORST OF THE WORST
TEAM UP.
THEY'RE LED BY ZAHEER...
LEADER OF THE RED LOTUS
AND MASTER OF THE SKIES!
A FLYING CHAOTIC CHAOS MACHINE!
HE'S JOINED BY VAATU...
THE ULTIMATE FORCE OF PURE
SPIRIT EVIL IN THE UNIVERSE!
"THE BIGGEST, MEANEST, SCARIEST"
KITE THAT EVER FLEW!
"WAIT, ZAHEER DIDN'T TEAM UP"
WITH VAATU.
HOW WOULD THAT EVEN HAPPEN?
 HOW DO YOU THINK?
 HELLO?
" HEY, IT'S ZAHEER."
" OH, HEY, ZAHEER."
GLAD I CAUGHT YOU AT HOME.
UH-HUH. VERY FUNNY.
LIKE I CAN LEAVE
THIS STUPID TREE.
HOLD ON. LET ME CONFERENCE IN...
 AMON!
THE REANIMATED ZOMBIE BODY
OF THE BLOODBENDING LEADER
OF THE EQUALISTS!
"HEY, GUYS, I'M TOTALLY IN"
FOR TAKING OUT BOLIN.
HE'S WAY TOO POWERFUL
AND AWESOME.
BUT CAN WE PLEASE NOT INCLUDE...
" NOT INCLUDE WHO, AMON?"
" THE EVIL UNALAQ,"
THE DIABOLICAL BUT INCREDIBLY
BORING AND UNPOPULAR SORCERER
"FROM THE NORTH, WHO'S LISTENING IN"
ON THE OTHER LINE!
I'VE SPENT MY LIFE
"TRYING TO DEFEAT NUKTUK,"
"I MEAN, BOLIN,"
AND I KNOW JUST WHERE
TO FIND HIM...
WITH ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES.
" YES, BOLIN HAD A REPUTATION"
AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST
LADIES' MAN.
"OOH, NOW THE STORY'S"
GETTING INTERESTING.
AFTER LEAVING THE BEAUTIFUL
BUT EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE
WATER TRIBE PRINCESS
"AT THE ALTAR,"
"HE MET A FETCHING AIRBENDER,"
THE HEIR TO A VAST
EARTH KINGDOM FORTUNE.
" OPAL, SO SMART AND CARING."
SO PRETTY TO SMELL...
AND SHE'LL PROBABLY NEVER
TALK TO ME AGAIN
BECAUSE I'M SO STUPID!
STUPID!
"SO, SO, SO STUPID!"
"PULL IT TOGETHER, YOU LEAKY LUG."
BUT THE DARKEST MOMENT
IS ALWAYS RIGHT BEFORE THE DAWN.
"FOR AT HIS LOWEST POINT,"
BOLIN SOUGHT ADVICE
"FROM THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL,"
THE WISEST OF THE WISE... ME!
FOR SOME OF MY SIGNATURE
SAGE ADVICE!
"NUKTUK, I MEAN, BOLIN,"
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
FOR YOU TO DO
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE AVATAR
AND DEFEAT
THE FEARSOME FOURSOME.
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
"IF I LIKE ""FEARSOME."""
"I MEAN, EVIL SQUARED"
MIGHT BE BETTER. WHATEVER.
YOU HAVE TO ASSEMBLE
THE FIGHTINGEST AIRBENDER ARMY
OF ALL TIME!
BUT IT TURNS OUT THE AIRBENDER
"RECRUITS ARE A SORRY LOT,"
SO BOLIN BRINGS THEM TO A
SECRET MOUNTAINTOP TRAINING FACILITY
WHERE HE TEACHES THEM THE
ANCIENT ART OF DODGING FRUIT
AND BALANCING ON STICKS!
"MEANWHILE,"
BACK WITH ZOMBIE AMON...
"OKAY, GUYS, I THINK"
WE FINALLY DITCHED HIM.
HA HA. VERY FUNNY.
I'M STILL ON THE LINE.
SO ABOUT THAT EVIL PLAN
TO DESTROY NUKTUK...
HELLO? ANYONE THERE?
GUYS!
"AND WITH DANGER CLOSING IN,"
OPAL REALIZES
HOW MUCH SHE LOVES BOLIN
AND FORGIVES HIM
FOR WHATEVER STUFF HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER
WHICH WILL PROBABLY NOT BE
IN THE FINAL CUT
OF THE MOVER ANYWAY.
 SHE DOES?
AWW.
" AND SHE KISSES BOLIN,"
MAGICALLY PASSING ON
THE AIRBENDER POWER OF FLIGHT!
"OKAY, THAT PART SEEMS"
A LITTLE UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS NO TIME
"FOR THINKING, KID."
WE'RE HEADING INTO
THE BIG FINALE!
BOLIN GATHERS HIS AIRBENDER ARMY
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE
ROH-TAN AND JUJI
AGAINST THE TERROR SQUARE!
MAYBE THAT'S THE NAME
OF THE BAD GUYS...
TERROR SQUARE.
WHAT ABOUT LEGION OF DARKNESS?
"WELL, WE'LL PUT A FOCUS GROUP"
ON IT.
BOLIN TEACHES THE AIRBENDERS
TO CREATE A GIANT TORNADO.
"THEN HE FLIES AROUND IN THE SKY,"
"PUSHES ZAHEER INTO IT,"
TURNING HIM INTO WIND FOREVER!
BUT BOLIN DOESN'T REALIZE THAT
THE UNIVERSAL INTERPLANETARY
COMBINATION ZERO HOUR...
TALK ABOUT A TICKING CLOCK.
IS ALMOST UPON HIM!
AND WHEN JUJI SHOOTS HIS
"LASER EYES AT THE EVIL UNALAQ,"
THE BEAMS ACCIDENTALLY FLY
INTO THE MAGIC SPIRIT DOORWAY!
"THEY BOUNCE OFF VAATU,"
"SETTING HIM FREE,"
"AND HIT BOLIN,"
TURNING HIM INTO A GIANT!
"BUT WHEN VAATU IS SET FREE,"
"THE EVIL UNALAQ,"
WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN
"ANNOYINGLY CLINGY PERSON,"
IS SO CLOSE TO VAATU
THAT THEY COMBINE
INTO ONE HORRIFYING MONSTER!
GIANT BOLIN
AND THE EVIL UNAVAATU FIGHT
"TOE-TO-TOE, ZAPPING EACH OTHER"
WITH THEIR LASER BEAMS
AS THEY STOMP AROUND
REPUBLIC CITY.
IT LOOKS LIKE
"THE EVIL UNAVAATU MIGHT WIN,"
"BUT THANKFULLY,"
BOLIN'S SPIRITUAL MOJO
IS SO STRONG THAT HE ATTRACTS
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES!
"WITH HER HELP, BOLIN TURNS"
UNAVAATU INTO MAGIC DUST
AND SPRAYS HIM INTO THE SKY.
AND THAT'S WHERE
THE STARS COME FROM.
"OH, YEAH,"
"AND HE TURNS INTO A DRAGON,"
AND HE GOES INTO THE SPIRIT
WORLD AND SAVES THE AVATAR.
THE END!
WAIT. YOU LIKE THAT?
IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!
WHAT ABOUT ZOMBIE AMON?
"WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, HUH?"
AND-AND-AND-AND STARS
ARE MAGIC FAIRY DUST?
ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?
ARE YOU CRAZY?
IT'S JUST A MOVER.
DON'T OVERTHINK IT.
IT'S LIKE A RIDE.
 NEVER LET THE TRUTH
GET IN THE WAY
"OF A GOOD STORY, KID."
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
KORRA IS SAFELY BACK
"IN REPUBLIC CITY,"
BUT BOLIN AND VARRICK
ARE STILL ON THE LAM.
"WEEKS AGO, KORRA REMOVED"
"THE REMAINING POISON FROM HER BODY,"
BUT THE MEMORY OF ZAHEER'S
ATTACK STILL TORMENTS HER.
AND AFTER
"BEING DEFEATED BY KUVIRA,"
SHE QUESTIONS
IF SHE WILL EVER FULLY RECOVER.
"MEANWHILE, KUVIRA HAS BEEN"
SECRETLY HARVESTING
SPIRIT VINES FROM THE SWAMP.
BUT HOW CLOSE IS SHE TO COMPLETING
HER SPIRIT ENERGY WEAPON?
"EVERYONE, MOM,"
"CAN WE STAY TOGETHER, PLEASE?"
THE TOUR'S ABOUT TO BEGIN.
 THAT'S MY BOY... RYU.
"HE USED TO LIVE IN THE BASEMENT,"
"BUT THEN HE GOT AIRBENDING,"
AND HE'S BEEN DOING
IMPORTANT AIR NATION STUFF
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
HIS FATHER AND I
"ARE HERE VISITING HIM,"
AND WE'RE JUST HAVING
THE BEST TIME IN THE BIG CITY.
"WE'RE SO PROUD, RIGHT, HONEY?"
 AT LEAST HE HAS A JOB NOW.
"MOM, DAD, I'M TRYING TO WORK."
"FUN FACT, EVERYONE:"
ALL THESE VINES
WERE CREATED BY UNAVAATU
WHEN HE BATTLED GIANT SPIRIT KORRA
FOR THE FATE OF THE WORLD.
EXCUSE ME.
ARE WE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD RIGHT NOW?
NO.
IS THE SPIRIT WORLD
IN THE GROUND BELOW US?
"NO, CAN I JUST"
GET THROUGH MY CARDS?
"OH, HONEY, DON'T GET FLUSTERED."
 I'M NOT!
"UH, WHY IS THAT VINE"
COMING TOWARD US?
"UH, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING"
ABOUT THAT ON THE CARDS.
 I'M GONNA POKE IT WITH A STICK.
NO! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
OHH!
OH! OH!
 EVERYONE BACK!
 THIS TOUR IS EXCITING!
ISN'T HE THE BEST AIRBENDER EVER...
UGH!
 EVERYTHING OKAY?
" NO, KUVIRA HAS MY FAMILY,"
AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE BUT ME.
 WE ALL CARE.
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET THEM BACK SAFELY.
" GUYS, THERE YOU ARE!"
I JUST FELT A WEIRD SURGE OF SPIRITUAL
ENERGY COMING FROM THE SPIRIT WILDS.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
ARE YOU SURE
YOU FELT A DISTURBANCE?
MAYBE YOU JUST HAD
SOME BAD FOOD FOR BREAKFAST.
I'M TELLING YOU. I FELT IT.
MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO RYU'S TOUR GROUP.
WE SHOULD'VE
RUN INTO THEM BY NOW.
" YEAH, BUT IT'S RYU."
THEY MIGHT BE AT THE MALL
FOR ALL WE KNOW.
"KORRA, CAN'T YOU FEEL"
HOW STRANGE THE ENERGY IS?
" NO, BUT..."
MAYBE I CAN GET A READING.
"KORRA, WHAT IS IT? ARE YOU OKAY?"
 IT WAS KUVIRA.
I SAW HER TAKING VINES
FROM THE SWAMP.
IT MUST BE AFFECTING
OUR SPIRIT WILDS.
I BET THAT'S WHAT
"YOU WERE SENSING, JINORA."
 WHY IS SHE TAKING VINES?
"WHATEVER THE REASON,"
I'M SURE IT'S NOT GOOD.
 WE HAVE TO TELL RAIKO.
THIS MIGHT HELP HIM CONVINCE
THE OTHER LEADERS
TO FINALLY TAKE HER DOWN.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING FOR RYU
AND THE OTHERS.
I SAY WE DEAL WITH THIS
KUVIRA SITUATION IMMEDIATELY.
YES! AGREED!
AND I KNOW JUST HOW TO GET RID OF HER:
WE TELL HER SHE WON
AN ALL-EXPENSE-PAID VACATION
TO A TROPICAL ISLAND.
"THEN WHEN SHE GETS THERE,"
WE REVEAL IT WAS A TRAP...
THE ISLAND'S A PRISON!
BOOM! GOT HER!
"OR, OKAY, UH,"
I'M JUST SPITBALLING HERE.
WE MARCH IN WITH AN ARMY
OF HIGHLY TRAINED BADGERMOLES!
DO WE KNOW IF KUVIRA
HAS ANY ALLERGIES?
"LOOK, I THINK WE ALL KNOW"
WHAT MUST BE DONE.
WE TAKE THE FIGHT TO HER.
I DON'T BELIEVE
"ATTACKING IS THE RIGHT MOVE,"
SINCE SHE HASN'T DONE
ANYTHING AGGRESSIVE
TOWARD THE UNITED REPUBLIC.
NOT YET.
BUT KUVIRA CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
SHE TOLD US THAT
"SHE WAS GOING TO TURN OVER POWER,"
AND SHE DIDN'T. I'M WITH RAIKO.
I SAY WE GO ON THE OFFENSIVE
AND START BY RETAKING ZAOFU.
"PRESIDENT RAIKO,"
"I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT..."
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
" OH, HEY, AVATAR KORRA."
"JUST KICKIN' IT WORLD LEADER STYLE,"
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO ABOUT KUVIRA.
"FOR THE RECORD, I TOLD RAIKO"
HE SHOULD'VE INVITED YOU.
 YOU INVITED HIM BUT NOT ME?
"PLEASE, KORRA,"
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.
WE JUST THOUGHT PERHAPS
WE CALLED YOU BACK
INTO ACTION A LITTLE TOO SOON.
" AGAIN... HIM, NOT ME?"
"KORRA, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE"
"OF A MEETING,"
AND WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE
JUST BARGE IN WHENEVER THEY WANT!
 GUYS!
"OH, PERFECT! YOU'RE ALL HERE!"
BOLIN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
"GUARDS, REMOVE THESE TRAITORS!"
NO! WE ESCAPED KUVIRA'S ARMY!
WE'RE BACK ON YOUR SIDE NOW!
WE HAVE TOP SECRET INFORMATION
FOR YOU!
"OKAY, I GUESS WE SHOULD HAVE"
OPENED WITH THAT LINE.
LISTEN TO ME. KUVIRA IS MAKING
THIS THING THAT GOES...
"I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS,"
BUT IT HAS THIS...
IT'S A SUPER WEAPON!
"LIKE A REGULAR WEAPON, ONLY SUPER!"
AND LET ME GUESS. IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH SPIRIT VINES.
YES! HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I SAW A VISION OF HER
TAKING SPIRIT VINES FROM THE SWAMP.
IF SHE FIGURES OUT
"HOW TO HARNESS THEIR POWER,"
WE ARE ALL DOOMED.
SHE MIGHT USE THE WEAPON
TO ATTACK REPUBLIC CITY.
THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT OURSELVES
IS WITH A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.
MY AIRBENDERS WON'T BE PART
OF AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK.
 NEITHER WILL THE FIRE NATION.
"BUT, FIRE LORD IZUMI,"
KUVIRA IS A THREAT TO THE WORLD.
SHE HAS TO BE STOPPED!
THE FIRE NATION HAS SPENT
TOO MUCH OF ITS HISTORY
"FIGHTING NONSENSE WARS,"
AND I REFUSE TO DRAG MY NATION
INTO ANOTHER ONE
UNLESS THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.
"IF YOU ATTACK KUVIRA,"
YOU'LL DO IT WITHOUT MY ARMY.
FINE. I'LL HOLD OFF
ANY PLANS OF ATTACK.
WE'LL GO ON THE DEFENSIVE
AND FORTIFY SECURITY ON THE BORDERS.
" IN THAT, YOU'LL HAVE MY HELP."
" OPAL, WAIT! PLEASE."
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.
"I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY,"
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR SORRY.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
"I DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU,"
"AND I SIDED WITH KUVIRA,"
AND I HELPED HER TAKE OVER
THE EARTH KINGDOM
AND TOPPLE YOUR HOME
AND GET YOUR MOM CAPTURED
AND YOUR BROTHERS AND YOUR DAD...
"WOW, THAT DOES SOUND REALLY BAD"
WHEN I SAY IT OUT LOUD LIKE THAT.
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
"PARDON ME, LOVEBIRDS,"
BUT I NEED A WORD WITH OPAL.
PRIVATELY.
"I'M SORRY, KID,"
BUT RAIKO COULDN'T CONVINCE
THE OTHER LEADERS TO ATTACK KUVIRA.
 SO OUR FAMILY...
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO SAVE THEM OURSELVES.
DON'T YOU THINK SOME OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD AGREE TO GO WITH US?
 THIS IS AN UNSANCTIONED
AND DANGEROUS MISSION
INTO ENEMY TERRITORY.
WE CAN'T ASK OTHER PEOPLE
TO RISK THEIR NECKS FOR OUR FAMILY.
"IF WE WANT TO BREAK THEM OUT,"
WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT ALONE.
" BOLIN, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK."
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
 WE ALL WERE.
" THANKS, GUYS."
"MAKO, I'M SO SORRY"
ABOUT THE WAY WE LEFT THINGS.
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
"YOU TRIED TO WARN ME ABOUT KUVIRA,"
"AND I RAN OFF ANYWAY, LIKE AN IDIOT."
"YOU WERE RIGHT,"
AND I'M JUST AN IDIOT.
I HOPE THAT I'LL BE ABLE
TO EARN YOUR TRUST AGAIN.
"IF ANYONE HAS LOST PEOPLE'S TRUST,"
IT'S ME.
"EVER SINCE KUVIRA KICKED MY BUTT,"
NO ONE EVEN WANTS ME AROUND.
 WE WANT YOU AROUND.
"AND, BOLIN, YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT."
YOU WERE JUST DOING
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
" AW, I LOVE YOU GUYS."
AND I REALLY WANT TO HUG AGAIN.
AGH!
UGH!
AH!
KORRA! THE VINES!
THEY'RE TAKING ME!
HELP!
 GET EVERYONE OUT OF HERE!
PUT UP A PERIMETER.
CANCEL ALL TOURS.
SOMEBODY GET AHOLD OF TENZIN.
WE GOT TO GET IN THERE
AND FIND JINORA.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD
BE GOING IN THERE RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW I'M NOT THE OLD AVATAR
"I USED TO BE, BUT I CAN DO THIS."
BE CAREFUL.
 JINORA!
HELLO? ANYONE?
WAIT. DO YOU HEAR THAT?
OH! OH!
 COME ON!
" KORRA, LOOK."
WHAT ARE THOSE?
 IT'S JINORA AND THE REST OF THEM.
THEIR SPIRITS ARE TRAPPED
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
 LET'S GET THEM OUT.
DON'T! YOU'LL PROVOKE THE VINES.
LET ME TRY.
THEY WON'T OPEN.
MAYBE IF I MEDITATE
"INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD, I CAN FREE THEM."
WAIT...
THIS ISN'T THE SPIRIT WORLD.
ZAHEER! NO!
YOU CAN'T FIGHT ME
AND THE POISON.
" NO, I GOT IT OUT."
 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT!
" KORRA, WHAT'S WRONG?"
 IT'S ZAHEER.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE'S BEEN HAUNTING ME
EVER SINCE I FOUGHT HIM.
I CAN'T GET ANY PEACE.
IT'S LIKE HE'S BLOCKING ME
FROM MEDITATING INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.
I'M HERE FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
 I WANT TO FACE ZAHEER.
" KORRA, HE'S TOO DANGEROUS."
"EVEN WHEN HE'S LOCKED UP,"
HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
I NEED TO IF I WANT
TO SAVE JINORA AND THE OTHERS;
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.
I'M CALLING YOUR FATHER.
HE CAN LEAD AN EXPEDITION
INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD
FROM THE SOUTHERN PORTAL.
"YOU'VE LOST FAITH IN ME TOO,"
HAVEN'T YOU?
NO ONE THINKS I'M CAPABLE
OF ANYTHING ANYMORE.
 IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.
 I KNOW I CAN DO THIS.
 I'M JUST SO WORRIED FOR JINORA.
I CAN'T IMAGINE IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO YOU TOO.
" TENZIN, PLEASE..."
I'LL BE OKAY.
ZAHEER'S IMPRISONED DEEP
IN THE MOUNTAINS OUTSIDE THE CITY.
I'LL CALL RAIKO
AND GET THE CLEARANCE.
 THANK YOU.
" PAB-PABS, WHERE ARE YOU?"
PABU!
"OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!"
"SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD,"
BUT OPAL'S KIND OF MAD AT ME.
I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD HELP ME WIN HER BACK.
"AWESOME! YES, I HAVE AN IDEA."
" HELLO, PABU."
"WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO."
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?
" OPAL, YOU MADE IT."
 WHAT'S THIS?
"A PICNIC,"
JUST FOR THE TWO OF US.
"WELL, THREE OF US. SORRY, PABS."
 SO THIS NOTE PABU BROUGHT ME
SAYING YOU BROKE
BOTH OF YOUR LEGS
WAS JUST A RUSE?
MAYBE...
"BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,"
DON'T YOU WANT TO
"JUST SIT BACK, RELAX,"
TRY SOME OF
MY HOMEMADE STEAM BUNS...
PEMA'S RECIPE...
AND WATCH PABU DO SOME
OF HIS WORLD FAMOUS BACKFLIPS
FOR ENTERTAINMENT?
HA-HA!
" OH, STEAM BUNS... MY FAVORITE."
THIS WILL TOTALLY MAKE ME FORGET
"THAT YOU WORKED FOR KUVIRA,"
THE PERSON WHO CAPTURED MY FAMILY
AND IS PROBABLY TORTURING THEM
RIGHT NOW.
"SO, YEAH, LET'S JUST SIT DOWN"
AND HAVE A GREAT PICNIC
BECAUSE WE'RE SO IN LOVE!
I'M SORRY
"YOU HAD TO SEE THAT, PABU."
 THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING.
IT'S NICE TO BE WELCOMED
BACK WITH OPEN ARMS.
"ACTUALLY, I BROUGHT YOU HERE"
OUT OF NECESSITY.
IT'S NO SECRET
"I NEVER LIKED YOU,"
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU TRIED
TO HAVE ME KIDNAPPED.
 ALLEGEDLY.
RIGHT.
EVERYTHING YOU DO
"IS ""ALLEGEDLY,"""
LIKE WHEN YOU TOOK OVER MY COMPANY
AND BOMBED THE SOUTHERN
WATER TRIBE CULTURAL CENTER.
 I OWN THAT BUILDING!
A MAN HAS THE RIGHT
TO BLOW UP HIS OWN PROPERTY!
"RIGHT NOW, I NEED YOU"
TO PUT ASIDE YOUR DIFFERENCES.
IF KUVIRA REALLY IS CREATING
"A SUPER WEAPON,"
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
THE TWO BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE CITY
WORKING TOGETHER TO STOP IT.
"WHAT DO YOU SAY, ASAMI?"
PARTNERS AGAIN?
 FINE. I'LL HELP.
BUT DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
DOUBLE-CROSSING ME AGAIN.
OW... UH-HUH.
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE READY FOR THIS?
 YES.
"I THINK IF I SEE ZAHEER CHAINED UP,"
I'LL FINALLY REALIZE THAT
HE'S NOT A THREAT ANYMORE.
 APPROACH THE WALL.
NO. I NEED TO DO THIS ALONE.
I FIGURED YOU WOULD SHOW UP
SOONER OR LATER.
SO...
YOU MUST REALLY BE IN TROUBLE
IF YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE TO SEE ME.
I CAME HERE
TO LOOK YOU IN THE EYE
AND TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE
NO POWER OVER ME.
I WILL NO LONGER
BE SCARED OF YOU.
I GUESS IT DIDN'T WORK.
YOU STILL SEEM SCARED.
 THIS WAS A MISTAKE.
 I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.
 YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME!
 YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.
I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME
"IN THE SPIRIT WORLD,"
AND IT'S WELL-KNOWN
THAT THE AVATAR'S SPIRIT
HASN'T BEEN THERE
FOR A FEW YEARS.
YOU CAN MEDITATE INTO
THE SPIRIT WORLD FROM HERE?
DOESN'T FEEL
VERY SPIRITUALLY CHARGED.
 THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.
REPUBLIC CITY IS FLOWING
"WITH SPIRITUAL ENERGY,"
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TAP INTO IT.
" NO, MY PROBLEM IS YOU."
YOU POISONED ME!
YOU RUINED ME!
PEOPLE USED TO THINK
"I WAS UNSTOPPABLE,"
BUT NOW THEY DON'T THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF ANYTHING!
BLAMING ME IS A CRUTCH
"TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,"
BUT IT'S NOT HELPING YOU RECOVER.
I THOUGHT SEEING YOU FACE-TO-FACE
"WOULD PUT AN END TO ALL OF THIS,"
BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME I REALIZE
I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME.
NEITHER OF US ARE THE SAME
AS BEFORE.
"I LEARNED TO FLY,"
BUT NOW I'M BOUND IN CHAINS.
YOU HAVE ALL THE POWER IN THE WORLD
"AND THE FREEDOM TO USE IT,"
BUT YOU CHOOSE
TO HOLD YOURSELF DOWN.
" I'M NOT HOLDING MYSELF DOWN,"
BUT MY POWERS HAVE LIMITS.
 YOU'RE WRONG.
"THAT POISON SHOULD'VE KILLED YOU,"
BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO FIGHT IT OFF.
YOU THINK YOUR POWER HAS LIMITS;
I SAY IT'S LIMITLESS.
 WHATEVER.
"BEFORE, YOU WERE ALWAYS TALKING"
ABOUT CHAOS AND FREEDOM.
THEN YOU TOOK OUT THE EARTH QUEEN
AND CREATED THE WORST DICTATOR
THE EARTH KINGDOM HAS EVER SEEN.
THANKS FOR THAT.
" I'VE HEARD RUMORS ABOUT HER,"
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE ACHIEVED SO MUCH POWER.
SHE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED.
"WELL, I CAN'T STOP HER"
UNLESS I GET OVER THIS BLOCK.
 I THINK I CAN HELP.
LET ME LEAD YOU INTO THE SPIRIT WORLD.
 NO WAY. I CAN'T TRUST YOU.
 MAYBE NOT.
"BUT IF YOU HAD ANY OTHER OPTIONS,"
"YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW,"
WOULD YOU?
"WE MAY HAVE BEEN ENEMIES ONCE,"
"BUT FOR NOW, OUR INTERESTS ALIGN."
 I'VE COME THIS FAR.
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOSE?
" FOCUS ON THE SOUND OF MY VOICE,"
AND CLEAR YOUR MIND.
 LET IT PLAY OUT.
 I CAN'T!
 YOU CAN.
ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
DON'T FEAR WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
 I HAVE NO CONTROL!
 DON'T BE AFRAID.
HOLD ON.
I MADE IT...
AND YOU LED ME HERE.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
JINORA AND THE OTHERS ARE?
" NO, BUT YOU DO."
"RAAVA, I MISSED YOU."
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
INSIDE OF YOU.
 CAN YOU HELP ME FIND JINORA?
HOW DO I RELEASE THEIR SPIRITS?
YOU MUST BEND THE ENERGY WITHIN.
BUT I'M POWERLESS
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
NO. YOU'RE MOST POWERFUL HERE.
"IN THE SPIRIT WORLD, YOU'RE CONNECTED"
TO ALL THE SPIRITUAL ENERGY.
 UH...
I FEEL ALL SPIRITY.
DAD!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW DID YOU GET OUT?
 KORRA SAVED US.
 SO...
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 I FEEL WHOLE AGAIN.
I FEEL GOOD.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FINALLY ABLE
TO FORGET ABOUT
WHAT ZAHEER DID TO YOU?
 NO.
BUT I AM FINALLY ABLE
"TO ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENED,"
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA
MAKE ME STRONGER.
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WE'VE GOT SOME FAMILY
BUSINESS TO TAKE CARE OF.
"ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,"
"BEFORE YOU GO,"
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD DO
OR NO BIG GESTURE THAT CAN
"MAKE UP FOR ALL MY MISTAKES,"
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
"I'M GONNA STOP TRYING TO WIN YOU BACK,"
BECAUSE...
I LOVE YOU.
 THANKS FOR SAYING ALL OF THAT.
"YOU KNOW, THERE IS ONE THING"
YOU COULD DO TO WIN ME BACK.
" WHAT IS IT? YES, I'LL DO ANYTHING!"
 COME ON A SECRET MISSION WITH US.
 WHERE TO?
 ZAOFU.
WE'RE GOING TO RESCUE MY FAMILY.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
AFTER KUVIRA HARVESTED
"SPIRIT VINES FROM THE SWAMP,"
THE VINES IN REPUBLIC CITY
REACTED BY ABDUCTING PEOPLE.
"KORRA SAVED EVERYONE,"
BUT ALL IS NOT WELL.
VARRICK AND BOLIN RETURNED
TO WARN EVERYONE
ABOUT KUVIRA'S
SPIRIT VINE SUPER WEAPON.
NOW RAIKO WANTS TO MOUNT
A DEFENSE
AGAINST THE EARTH EMPIRE.
"MEANWHILE, BOLIN, OPAL,"
AND LIN ARE ON A MISSION
TO RESCUE SU BEIFONG
"AND HER FAMILY,"
WHO ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE
BY KUVIRA.
"ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS."
SAVING THE BEIFONGS
AND SAVING OUR LOVE
BECAUSE I VOW TO REPAIR
THE RIFT THAT HAS GROWN BETWIXT US
AND MAKE US WHOLE AGAIN!
"YOU, ZIP IT NOW."
I HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR BABBLE
ON THE RIDE IN.
"YES, MA'AM."
KUVIRA TORE DOWN ALL THE DOMES.
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
SHE'S GOT A WHOLE BATTALION
OF TROOPS STATIONED THERE.
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO SPOT
ANYTHING USEFUL FROM HERE.
WE'LL HAVE TO GO IN
FOR A CLOSER LOOK.
DON'T BOTHER.
ALL THE PRISONERS
HAVE BEEN MOVED.
"UH, HEY, CHIEF."
"HEY, CHIEF."
GRANDMA TOPH!
YOU WERE ONLY UP TO MY WAIST
THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER.
"OH, MAN! OH, I CAN'T!"
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!
WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE TO PEE OR SOMETHING?
"NO, WELL, NOW MAYBE."
YOU'RE MY HERO!
MY NAME IS BOLIN.
"I'M DATING YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER,"
"I MEAN, KIND OF."
"I MAY HAVE SCREWED THAT UP,"
"BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,"
AND YOU'RE MY HERO!
"OH, I SAID THAT."
CAN I HAVE A HUG TOO?
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?
HE'S AN ACTOR.
SO YOU ALREADY CHECKED
THE CITY FOR SU?
HOW DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS CAPTURED?
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN THE SWAMP
AND KEEPING WATCH ON ZAOFU
THROUGH THE VINES.
"SURE, OKAY, MAKES SENSE."
"BY THE TIME I GOT HERE,"
THEY WERE GONE.
I SNOOPED AROUND TOWN
AND HEARD THAT THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY
TO SOME NEARBY PRISON CAMP.
WHERE WOULD THAT BE?
THERE'S A FACTORY
AND REEDUCATION FACILITY
NOT TOO FAR AWAY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
BOLIN USED TO WORK FOR KUVIRA.
HOW DID YOU END UP DATING
THE KIND OF DIPSTICK
WHO WORKS FOR KUVIRA?
USED TO!
"IT'S NOT HIS SILVER TONGUE,"
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
PLEASE TELL ME THIS ATTITUDE
ISN'T HEREDITARY.
"GRANDMA, THIS IS JUICY."
AND I THOUGHT APPA WAS SMELLY.
WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE
"THIS LEAKY, NASTY THING?"
YOU DON'T CHOOSE YOUR BISON.
HE CHOOSES YOU.
"AND ONCE HE CHOOSES YOU,"
YOU CAN'T CHANGE.
BELIEVE ME. I CHECKED.
"THE BORDERS ARE SECURE,"
AND TROOPS ARE GUARDING
THE RAIL LINES INTO THE CITY.
SO WHAT HAVE YOU TWO GENIUSES
COME UP WITH
TO FEND OFF KUVIRA?
IT'S A FLYING MECHA-SUIT.
ASAMI GOT THE IDEA FROM
WATCHING DRAGONFLY-HUMMINGBIRDS.
"YOU CAN TAKE OFF STRAIGHT UP,"
FLY IN ANY DIRECTION.
WHERE DOES THE SPIRIT RAY
COME OUT?
IT DOESN'T HAVE A SPIRIT RAY.
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I TOLD KUVIRA:
THAT TECHNOLOGY
SHOULD NOT BE USED.
IT'S ALREADY BEING USED
BY KUVIRA!
"I NEED SPIRIT VINE WEAPONS,"
AND I NEED THEM NOW!
NO. IT WAS KUVIRA'S HARVESTING
OF THE VINES IN THE SWAMP
THAT CAUSED
THE REPUBLIC CITY VINES
TO GO CRAZY
AND GRAB ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.
WHY CAN'T YOU HARVEST THE VINES?
"I WON'T DO THAT,"
BUT MAYBE SINCE THE SPIRITS
"LOVE REPUBLIC CITY SO MUCH,"
I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO HELP US
DEFEND IT SOMEHOW.
HMM.
"OKAY, MAYBE WHILE THE"
WEAPON GENIUSES
AND THE SPIRIT BRIDGE
"ARE GETTING READY FOR BATTLE,"
WE SHOULD BE EVACUATING
THE ORDINARY CITIZENS
"SO THAT IF KUVIRA ATTACKS,"
THEY WON'T BE HURT.
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA.
"PRINCE WU, YOU WORK"
WITH THE POLICE TO COORDINATE
GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CITY.
NOW EVERYONE GET TO IT.
I WANT DAILY UPDATES.
NICE JOB IN THERE.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
YOU'RE STARTING TO ACT LIKE
THE KIND OF KING
 I'D LIKE TO WORK FOR.
 THANKS.
AND IF KORRA BUYS
"THIS ""MAN OF THE PEOPLE"" THING,"
I STILL MIGHT GET TO DATE HER.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO RUIN IT.
WHAT? COME ON!
WHY DO YOU THINK
GUYS DO ANYTHING GREAT?
TO PICK UP GIRLS.
"EVERY WORK OF ART,"
"EVERY SONG,"
EVERY CITY EVACUATION...
ALL FOR THE LADIES.
"ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,"
LET'S TEST THE POWER CORE.
I WANT EVERYTHING IN ORDER
FOR THE FULL DEMONSTRATION
FOR KUVIRA TOMORROW.
LOAD THE ENERGY CAPSULE.
"ZHU LI, INITIALIZE PHASE ONE."
THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE CONDENSER.
IT'S BACKING UP.
SHUT IT DOWN.
I CAN'T.
THE OVERRIDE ISN'T WORKING.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO EVACUATE.
THIS THING IS GOING TO BLOW!
EVERYONE GET OUT! NOW!
"COME ON, BAATAR! IT'S TOO LATE!"
THIS CHANNELING RING
WAS CRACKED.
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE
REACTION TO OVERLOAD.
NOW WE'RE TAKING
THIS WHOLE THING APART TONIGHT
AND CHECKING EVERYTHING.
NOTHING IS TOO SMALL.
THIS HAS TO BE READY
BY TOMORROW.
SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE
YOU TWO HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER?
LITTLE WHILE NOW.
COUPLE OF YEARS.
TRY 20.
"AH, TIME FLIES"
WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE.
I'M SURPRISED
YOU CAME TO SAVE SU.
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
DIDN'T GET ALONG.
SU AND I FINALLY WORKED OUT
OUR OLD GRIEVANCES.
"GOOD, GLAD WE CAN PUT ALL THAT"
BEHIND US.
"RIGHT. ""WE."""
"OKAY, THERE'S THE FACTORY."
"WHOA, THAT'S ONE BIG..."
THING.
I THINK I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
FEEL THAT CAVERN
A FEW STORIES DOWN?
"IT SEEMS EMPTY, BUT IT'S GUARDED"
BY AN AWFUL LOT OF MECH.
RIGHT.
WHY WOULD YOU NEED SOLDIERS
GUARDING AN EMPTY CAVERN?
THEY MUST HAVE THEM IN SOME
"KIND OF SUSPENDED PRISON,"
SO THEY CAN'T USE
THEIR EARTHBENDING.
SOMEONE'S COMING. HIDE!
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
UNTIL TOMORROW.
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN
TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING WAS ON TRACK.
IT LOOKS WONDERFUL.
WE'VE HAD
"A FEW MINOR MALFUNCTIONS,"
BUT WE SHOULD BE READY
FOR THE TEST TOMORROW.
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
"THE ENTIRE TIME, ZHU LI."
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE PROBLEM IS?
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX MACHINE.
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE
SOME BUGS TO WORK OUT.
BUT YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING
"YOU CAN TO FIX THOSE, CORRECT?"
"OF COURSE, YOUR EMINENCE."
SHE'S LYING.
TELL THE TROOPS
AND FACTORY WORKERS
TO ATTEND
TOMORROW'S DEMONSTRATION.
I WANT THEM ALL TO WITNESS
THIS INCREDIBLE NEW WEAPON IN ACTION.
WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF A WAY
TO TAKE OUT KUVIRA
WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE.
OR AT LEAST DESTROY THE CANNON.
IF SHE TAKES THAT
"TO REPUBLIC CITY,"
IT COULD OBLITERATE EVERYTHING.
I DIDN'T COME TO FIGHT
WITH KUVIRA OR DESTROY A CANNON.
I'M HERE TO SAVE MY FAMILY.
IT WILL TAKE EVERYTHING
WE HAVE JUST TO GET OUT ALIVE.
HMM.
KUVIRA WANTS
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER PEOPLE
"TO SEE THE WEAPON TEST TOMORROW,"
SO THE FACTORY WILL BE
MOSTLY EMPTY THEN.
THAT'S OUR BEST CHANCE
TO SNEAK IN
AND FREE SU
WITHOUT BEING SPOTTED.
"GOOD THINKING, BOLIN."
THANKS. I KIND OF
HAVE A HEADACHE NOW.
"EXCUSE ME, SPIRIT?"
CAN I TALK TO...
AND YOU'RE GONE.
JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER SPIRITS.
THEY'RE ABANDONING THE CITY.
SO LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT METALBENDING.
"SU TRIED TO TEACH ME, BUT"
I COULDN'T GET THE HANG OF IT.
I USED TO HAVE AN ACADEMY
TO TRAIN METALBENDING.
EVEN BLOCKHEADS LIKE YOU
CAN FIGURE IT OUT
WITH THE RIGHT INSTRUCTION.
"YEAH, YOU'RE"
A REAL SENSITIVE INSTRUCTOR.
I DID LEARN HOW TO LAVABEND.
REALLY?
IT'S A VERY RARE ABILITY.
MAYBE YOU DO HAVE SOME TALENT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU THINK I'M TALENTED.
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME
COMING FROM MY HERO.
"YEAH, SHE'S REAL ENCOURAGING."
"HEY, I'M BLIND, NOT DEAF."
SO HERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT.
WHO'S LIN'S DAD?
HE WAS A GUY NAMED KANTO.
"NICE MAN, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY"
WORK OUT BETWEEN US.
AND...
OKAY.
"LIN, I CAN FEEL YOUR ENRAGED"
BREATHING FROM HERE.
"JUST SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY,"
AND LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.
JUST GET IT OVER WITH?
"YEAH, LET'S NOT LINGER"
ON THE FACT
THAT I GREW UP WITHOUT A DAD.
NO NEED TO GET
ALL TOUCHY-FEELY ABOUT IT.
"JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS, RIGHT?"
"HEY, I FORGAVE YOU"
FOR ALL YOUR GARBAGE
"A LONG TIME AGO,"
AND SU AND I WORKED THINGS OUT.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WANTS TO HOLD ON
TO THIS FAMILY DRAMA NONSENSE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
FORGAVE ME FOR WHAT?
AND NOT KNOWING MY DAD
IS NONSENSE TO YOU?
IT WAS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME.
"AND UNTIL NOW,"
YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN DISCUSS IT.
"YOU KNOW, AFTER SU AND I"
"PATCHED THINGS UP,"
"I THOUGHT, ""MAYBE I SHOULD TRY"
"TO REACH OUT TO MOM."""
BUT NOW THAT
"WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN,"
I REMEMBER
WHY WE STOPPED TALKING.
"YOU MAKE ME FURIOUS,"
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.
"AND WHEN I TELL YOU,"
YOU DON'T CARE.
"ONCE WE SAVE SU,"
YOU AND I ARE FINISHED.
IF THAT'S YOUR DECISION
"AND IT MAKES YOU HAPPY,"
THEN FINE.
THE TEST IS ABOUT TO START.
THEY'RE GOING TO BLOW UP
THAT EMPTY TOWN
WE FLEW OVER YESTERDAY.
YOU'RE CLEAR TO GO.
COPY THAT. WE'RE GOING IN.
THE GUARDS ARE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR.
WE'LL HAVE TO BE QUIET.
"SHOOT ME OVER TO THE CAGE,"
AND I CAN SWING THEM BACK
ON MY CABLE.
"BOLIN, YOU'LL HAVE TO CATCH THEM"
SINCE MOM WON'T BE ABLE
TO SEE THEM.
READY?
WE'LL GET YOU OUT ONE AT A TIME.
COME ON.
I GOT YOU!
CONGRATULATIONS
ON ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.
THIS WEAPON IS PROOF
THAT THE EARTH EMPIRE
IS THE STRONGEST NATION
IN THE WORLD.
"AND BELIEVE ME,"
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!
FIRE THE WEAPON.
WHAT'S WRONG?
PROBABLY SOMETHING MINOR.
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIND THE PROBLEM.
THE DISTRIBUTOR PIN IS GONE.
I SWEAR I LOCKED IT IN PLACE
YESTERDAY.
THERE'S NO WAY
IT COULD HAVE JUST FALLEN OUT.
AND THIS COULD CAUSE
THE ENTIRE WEAPON TO FAIL?
IT COULD CAUSE IT TO EXPLODE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?
NOTHING.
"YOU SWORE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME,"
AND I GAVE YOU
A CHANCE AT GREATNESS.
THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?
YOU'RE A MONSTER.
I REGRET NOTHING.
CHAIN HER UP IN THE TARGET TOWN.
SHE CAN SEE HOW THE WEAPON WORKS
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.
"OH, NO."
"SWEETIE, IT'LL BE FINE."
"LIN WON'T DROP YOU,"
AND BOLIN WILL CATCH YOU.
"NO, NO. JUST GO."
JUST LEAVE ME. I'LL STAY HERE.
"SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS."
AAH!
HUH?
THE PRISON. GET THERE NOW.
SHOULD WE POSTPONE THE TEST?
I DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY
TO STOP NOW.
FIRE WHEN READY.
I WANT TO SEE
THAT TOWN DESTROYED.
WE GOT 'EM. WE'RE COMING OUT.
MOM!
DAD!
THANK YOU.
LET'S MOVE.
KUVIRA CAUGHT ZHU LI
AND THREW HER IN THE TOWN.
"WHAT? NO, I HAVE TO GO SAVE HER."
"YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE, KID."
IT'S SUICIDE. KUVIRA'S ONTO US.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
TOO MUCH TOGETHER.
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.
"TOPH, YOU SAID ZHU LI WAS"
LYING ABOUT FIXING THE CANNON.
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO STOP IT.
"FOR ALL YOU KNOW,"
SHE COULD JUST HAVE BEEN
COVERING HER BUTT
BECAUSE SHE MADE A MISTAKE.
NO. ZHU LI DOESN'T
MAKE MISTAKES.
YOU GUYS LEAVE.
"IF WE MAKE IT OUT,"
WE'LL GET TO THE CITY SOMEHOW.
"BOLIN, NO!"
YOU GUYS GET OUT OF HERE.
I HAVE TO GO WITH BOLIN.
COULD BE OUR BEST CHANCE
TO STOP KUVIRA.
MAYBE TAKE OUT THAT WEAPON.
WE CAN'T LET OPAL BE
THE COOLEST.
IF YOU ALL WANT TO GET
YOURSELVES CAPTURED AGAIN
"OR WORSE, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS."
I'M THROUGH.
WATCH OUT FOR BAATAR SR.
AND HUAN.
"SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, MOTHER?"
I TOLD YOU
NEVER TO CALL ME THAT.
"SPIRITS, THIS IS THE AVATAR."
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.
"SINCE I OPENED THE PORTALS,"
SPIRITS AND HUMANS
HAVE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER
IN REPUBLIC CITY.
IT'S ALL I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR.
I KNOW YOU FELT THE EFFECTS
OF KUVIRA CUTTING DOWN
SPIRIT VINES.
BUT NOW ISN'T THE TIME
FOR YOU TO FLEE THE CITY.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO HELP ME
"SAVE IT FROM KUVIRA,"
WHO WAS PERVERTING SPIRIT
POWER TO USE AS A WEAPON
AGAINST OTHER HUMANS.
WE DON'T GET INVOLVED
WITH HUMAN WARS.
SPIRITS WORKED WITH UNALAQ.
HE WAS MISUSING VAATU'S POWER
DURING HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
TO FORCE SPIRITS TO FIGHT YOU.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
"NO, BUT AS THE AVATAR,"
I'M HOPING THAT
YOU WILL COME TO MY AID
TO SAVE THE NEW WORLD
WE ALL SHARE.
WHAT YOU WANT IS
"EXACTLY WHAT KUVIRA WANTS,"
TO USE SPIRITS AS A WEAPON
IN A HUMAN WAR.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
WAIT!
"PLEASE, LISTEN."
IF SPIRITS AND HUMANS
"ARE GONNA LIVE TOGETHER,"
WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER.
OPAL?
NO. WE HAVE TO STOP THE TEST.
WHOA.
AAH!
YOU GIVE METALBENDERS
A BAD NAME!
"THANKS FOR COMING TO SAVE US,"
MOM.
"YEAH, THANKS, CHIEF."
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID LAST NIGHT.
I WAS JUST... YOU KNOW.
"LOOK, I KNOW"
"I WASN'T A GREAT MOTHER,"
"BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,"
I ENDED UP WITH TWO GREAT KIDS.
GOOD ENOUGH TO RISK
"MY BONY OLD BUTT FOR, ANYWAY."
IF YOU CAN JUST FIND SOME WAY
"NOT TO HATE ME,"
"MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH,"
AT LEAST FOR ME.
ME TOO.
"YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD"
ANY FAMILY EXCEPT FOR MY BROTHER
"UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,"
AND REUNITING WITH THEM
MADE ME REALIZE HOW SPECIAL IT IS...
"ARGH, ENOUGH."
ENJOY THE RIDE BACK
TO THE CITY WITH THE GUM FLAPPER HERE.
AREN'T YOU COMING BACK
"TO REPUBLIC CITY WITH US, GRANDMA?"
"NO, MY FIGHTING DAYS ARE OVER."
"DON'T TELL KORRA,"
BUT MY BACK IS KILLING ME NOW.
THIS IS WHY
YOU DIDN'T SEE KATARA
MESSING WITH
THAT CIVIL WAR NONSENSE.
"AT SOME POINT,"
YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT TO THE KIDS.
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING BACK TO SAVE ME.
AND DON'T BE TOO HARD ON BOLIN
FOR WORKING WITH KUVIRA.
HIS HEART WAS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
I THINK BOLIN HAS WORKED HIS WAY
OUT OF THE POLAR BEAR-DOGHOUSE.
MWAH.
YES! HA-HA!
WE SHOULD GET GOING.
I'M AFRAID I HAVE BAD NEWS
TO DELIVER TO REPUBLIC CITY.
KUVIRA IS GOING TO ATTACK
IN TWO WEEKS.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
"BOLIN, OPAL, AND LIN"
RESCUED THE BEIFONGS
AND ZHU LI FROM KUVIRA.
NOW THEY'RE RACING TO REPUBLIC CITY
TO ALERT EVERYONE ABOUT
THE EARTH EMPIRE'S
"IMMINENT ATTACK. MEANWHILE,"
KORRA AND TEAM AVATAR HAVE
BEEN PREPARING FOR
JUST SUCH AN EVENT.
PRINCE WU IS LEADING
AN EVACUATION EFFORT
WHILE ASAMI AND VARRICK ARE
CREATING FLYING MECHA-SUITS.
BUT WITH KUVIRA PLANNING TO
"STRIKE IN ONLY TWO WEEKS,"
WILL THEY BE READY IN TIME?
TODAY WE STAND ON
THE PRECIPICE OF HISTORY.
"FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS,"
WE'VE FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE
TO UNITE THE EARTH EMPIRE
AND WE'VE PROVEN THAT
NO ONE CAN STAND IN OUR WAY.
NOT EVEN THE AVATAR.
BUT OUR MISSION IS NOT YET COMPLETE.
THERE IS A GRAVE INJUSTICE
THAT MUST BE CORRECTED.
"AS YOU ALL KNOW,"
"AFTER THE HUNDRED YEAR WAR,"
"AVATAR AANG, ALONG WITH"
FIRE LORD ZUKO
STOLE EARTH EMPIRE LAND AND
FORMED THE UNITED REPUBLIC.
THIS LAND BELONGS TO THE
PEOPLE OF THE EARTH EMPIRE
AND IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT BACK.
REPUBLIC CITY WILL BE OURS!
ALL HAIL THE GREAT UNITER!
ARE YOU READY TO SHOW THE WORLD
WHAT A TRUE SUPER POWER LOOKS LIKE?
YES. I'M HONORED TO MARCH
INTO THE CITY BY YOUR SIDE.
"I LOVE YOU, KUVIRA."
I NEVER COULD'VE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.
"AFTER WE CLAIM VICTORY,"
WE CAN FINALLY GET MARRIED
AND RULE OUR EMPIRE TOGETHER.
 HOW'S THE EVACUATION COMING?
 COULD BE BETTER.
AT THIS POINT WE'VE EVACUATED
ALMOST... 18 FAMILIES.
ONLY 18? THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE IN THIS CITY!
 I SAID IT COULD BE BETTER.
THE PROBLEM IS IT'S
A VOLUNTARY EVACUATION
AND THERE AREN'T MANY VOLUNTEERS.
THEY JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE IN ANY
IMMEDIATE DANGER.
 GUYS! GOOD! YOU'RE ALL HERE.
WHAT'S WITH YOU INTERRUPTING
MY IMPORTANT MEETINGS ALL THE TIME?
 SU!
WHAT ARE YOU... YOU'RE OKAY!
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ZAOFU.
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?
"OPAL, BEIFONG, AND I"
RESCUED EVERYONE
BUT WE HAD A RUN IN WITH KUVIRA.
WE SAW HER SUPER SPIRIT WEAPON
UP CLOSE.
"LIKE, REALLY CLOSE. WAY TOO CLOSE."
IS SHE GOING TO USE IT
AGAINST REPUBLIC CITY?
YES. I FOUND OUT SHE'S GOING
TO ATTACK IN TWO WEEKS.
OH! AND ZHU LI IS ON
OUR SIDE NOW.
"ACTUALLY, SHE NEVER REALLY"
SWITCHED SIDES.
AND I'M JUST GONNA LET HER
"EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING, ZHU LI?"
I PRETENDED TO BE LOYAL TO KUVIRA SO
I COULD SABOTAGE HER WEAPON.
"IT DIDN'T WORK, BUT I DID"
OVERHEAR HER PLANS TO ATTACK.
I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T STOP
AT ZAOFU.
"MY GUESS IS, SHE'S COMING"
BY RAIL.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY SHE CAN
TRANSPORT THAT WEAPON.
THEN WE'LL CUT THE RAIL LINES.
I AGREE. BUT LET'S GET
AS MANY CITIZENS
EVACUATED BEFORE WE DO.
PUT OUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
THE EVACUATION IS NOW MANDATORY.
 WE'RE ON IT.
" DON'T WORRY, MR. PRESIDENT."
I WON'T LET KUVIRA TAKE OUR CITY.
WELD HOTTER! TIGHTEN TIGHTER!
THE PRESIDENT SAID
WE ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS
TO GET THESE HUMMINGBIRDS HUMMING!
" VARRICK, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE."
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?
WHAT IS IT? I'M BUSY
INSPIRING MY WORKERS.
"WELL, I WENT TO ZAOFU"
AND SAVED SU AND HER FAMILY...
AND GUESS WHO ELSE WE FOUND... HA!
 ZHU LI.
"NOW, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING"
YOU WANTED TO SAY TO HER?
 HMM?
" PLEASE, LET ME GO FIRST."
I KNOW I SAID A LOT OF TERRIBLE THINGS
"ABOUT YOU IN FRONT OF KUVIRA,"
"BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW,"
I DIDN'T MEAN ONE WORD.
WHEN YOU WERE BEING TAKEN
"AWAY, I THOUGHT MY ONLY CHANCE"
TO SAVE YOU WAS TO JOIN HER.
BUT EVERY DAY I HOPED FOR THE
CHANCE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
"VARRICK, YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME,"
AND I'M SORRY IF I HURT YOU IN ANY WAY.
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
APOLOGY ACCEPTED!
NOW BE A GOOD ASSISTANT AND
MAN THE ASSEMBLY LINE!
NO! I AM NOT YOUR ASSISTANT
ANYMORE!
"IF YOU WANT ME AROUND,"
YOU NEED TO START TREATING ME
LIKE AN EQUAL.
WE'RE PATCHED IN ON
THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST LINE.
YOU'RE GOING OUT
TO EVERY RADIO IN THE CITY.
ATTENTION CITIZENS
"OF REPUBLIC CITY, THIS IS NOT A TEST."
AN ATTACK ON OUR CITY IS IMMINENT.
PRESIDENT RAIKO HAS ORDERED
A MANDATORY EVACUATION
FOR ALL CITIZENS.
PLEASE FIND
YOUR EVACUATION HANDBOOKS
AND TURN TO SUB-SECTION
ONE DASH TWO SIX.
THERE YOU WILL FIND INITIAL
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR AREA.
"FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LIVE IN"
NORTHWEST-VECTOR-ONE
REPORT TO YOUR PRIMARY MEETING
LOCATION
WHICH WOULD BE AT
THE EASTERN ENTRANCE
OF THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE LIBRARY.
"THERE, YOU WILL CHOOSE"
A LEADER AS SPECIFIED IN
SECTION ONE DASH TWO EIGHT.
"UH, CHIEF, WE'RE GETTING"
CONFUSED CALLS
FROM ALL OVER THE CITY.
I THINK MAKO'S STARTING A PANIC.
WHAT'S CONFUSING? I'M GIVING
VERY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS.
"GREAT, THIS IS JUST WHAT"
WE NEED.
 I GOT THIS.
"HELLO, EVERYONE. THIS IS PRINCE WU."
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
A LITTLE SCARED.
"BELIEVE ME, I KNOW WHAT IT'S"
LIKE TO BE AFRAID.
I USED TO NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO
THE BATHROOM BY MYSELF.
"BUT IF WE LET THAT FEAR CONTROL US,"
NONE OF US WILL EVER BE ABLE
"TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,"
AND THEN WE ALL LOSE.
BUT THE PEOPLE OF REPUBLIC CITY
"AREN'T LOSERS, WE'RE WINNERS!"
WINNERS THAT ARE GOING TO GET
OUT OF THIS CITY
IN A CALM AND ORDERLY FASHION.
"SO I WANT YOU TO GRAB YOUR FAMILY,"
"GRAB YOUR NEIGHBOR,"
GRAB THAT GUY DOWN THE STREET
YOU DON'T KNOW VERY WELL
AND HEAD TO THE NEAREST
"BUS, TRAIN, OR FERRY STATION."
"WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE,"
SAFE AND SOUND.
" GOOD JOB, KID."
YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE SUCH A BAD
KING AFTER ALL.
 ROHAN'S WITH THE ACOLYTES.
THEY HAVE THE BOAT READY TO LEAVE.
WHY AREN'T YOU ALL PACKED YET?
THE KIDS AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING
AND WE DECIDED WE WANNA STAY.
"THIS IS OUR CITY, AND IT'S GOING TO NEED"
ALL THE HELP IT CAN GET.
YEAH! ONLY A COWARD
FLEES HIS FATE.
 THANK YOU.
I'M SURE PRINCE WU COULD USE
YOUR HELP WITH THE EVACUATION.
AND YOU THREE CAN HELP
THE OTHER AIRBENDERS
KEEP AN EYE ON THE EARTH
EMPIRE TROOPS FROM ABOVE.
KUVIRA WILL RUE THE DAY SHE
MESSED WITH MEELO!
I STILL DON'T LIKE HAVING TO
ABANDON MY OFFICE AND THE CITY.
AIR TEMPLE ISLAND IS
THE IDEAL LOCATION
FOR YOUR BASE OF OPERATIONS.
AND YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE.
THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO
DISCUSS WITH YOU.
 WHAT IS IT?
THE FOUR OF US
HAVE BEEN TALKING AND...
WE WANT TO TAKE OUT
KUVIRA'S SPIRIT WEAPON
BEFORE IT GETS TOO CLOSE TO THE CITY.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RISK WE
DON'T NEED TO TAKE.
THE EVACUATION IS ON SCHEDULE
AND GENERAL IROH IS GETTING
HIS ARMY IN PLACE.
I KNOW IROH CAN GO TOE
"TO TOE WITH KUVIRA'S ARMY,"
 BUT THAT WEAPON...
 IT'S TOO POWERFUL!
IT CAN DESTROY THE CITY!
WE CAN'T LET IT GET TO
OUR DOORSTEP.
WE'LL SNEAK BEHIND ENEMY
LINES AND DISABLE THE WEAPON.
"IF IT WORKS, IT'LL EVEN"
THE PLAYING FIELD.
 BUT IF YOU GET CAUGHT...
 IT'S WORTH THE RISK.
"I AGREE, AND IT MIGHT BE"
OUR ONLY SHOT
AT PREVENTING AN ALL-OUT WAR.
 GOOD LUCK.
 WE'LL HEAD OUT TONIGHT.
 THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE.
IT'S KUVIRA'S ARMY!
THEY'RE A WEEK EARLY!
"GET THE COMMANDER IMMEDIATELY,"
AND RADIO REPUBLIC CITY!
"GUYS, I SEE"
SOMETHING. DOWN THERE!
 IS THAT?
 KUVIRA.
SHE'S ALREADY CROSSED INTO
UNITED REPUBLIC TERRITORY.
SHE'S A WEEK EARLY.
 THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THERE AREN'T ANY TRAIN TRACKS
THIS WAY.
HOW ARE THEY TRANSPORTING THAT
SUPER WEAPON OF THEIRS?
APPARENTLY ON A GIANT
MECHA-SUIT.
DID YOU KNOW KUVIRA WAS
BUILDING THAT THING?
"OH, DID I FORGET TO MENTION IT?"
NO! OF COURSE I DIDN'T KNOW!
THERE'S A FLYING BISON UP AHEAD.
 THE AVATAR...
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!
WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE NOW!
NOW!
 SHOULD WE GO AFTER THEM?
THEY'RE GOING TO WARN REPUBLIC CITY.
 LET THEM.
NO ONE CAN STOP US.
"KORRA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?"
WHY ARE YOU BACK SO SOON?
IT'S KUVIRA.
OUR INTEL WAS WRONG.
SHE MUST'VE KNOW ZHU LI HAD
THE INFORMATION.
 WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
KUVIRA'S ARMY IS ONLY
A FEW HOURS AWAY.
"NO, THEY CAN'T BE..."
WE'RE NOT READY.
AND THAT SPIRIT WEAPON OF HERS
IS ATTACHED TO A GIANT MECHA-SUIT.
IT'S OVER 25 STORIES TALL.
GET GENERAL IROH ON THE LINE
AND TELL HIM
THE ATTACK IS HAPPENING TODAY.
WE NEED TO LOCK DOWN THIS CITY.
"PEMA, FIND WU AND GET THE REMAINING"
CITIZENS TO SAFETY IMMEDIATELY.
WE CAN'T HAVE INNOCENT LIVES
IN JEOPARDY.
 WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
 LET'S GO TO MY FACTORY.
MAYBE WE CAN GET A FEW OF THOSE
HUMMINGBIRD SUITS UP AND RUNNING.
 WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.
I'LL HEAD TO THE FRONT LINES
AND HELP GENERAL IROH.
KUVIRA THIS IS PRESIDENT RAIKO.
I ORDER YOU TO STAND DOWN.
TURN YOUR ARMY AROUND AND LEAVE.
YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO GIVE ORDERS.
STAND DOWN OR WE WILL ATTACK.
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
THE POWER I POSSESS.
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO BUILD THAT WEAPON!
"MR. PRESIDENT, DO I HAVE"
YOUR ORDER TO ENGAGE?
YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS
OR I WIPE OUT YOUR ARMY.
 I HAVE NO CHOICE.
 TIME'S UP.
STOP. WE SURRENDER.
REPUBLIC CITY IS YOURS.
GOOD. TURN YOUR ARMY AND
THE AVATAR
OVER TO ME AND GIVE BAATAR
YOUR LOCATION.
HE'LL PRESENT YOU WITH OUR TERMS.
 I'M NOT SURRENDERING!
GET BACK TO THE CITY BEFORE
SHE SEES YOU.
"AND KORRA, FIND A WAY TO BEAT"
THAT THING.
 I WILL.
WE'VE DONE IT KUVIRA.
AND I JUST GOT WORD THAT
PRESIDENT RAIKO
IS ON AIR TEMPLE ISLAND.
I'M HEADING THERE NOW.
RAIKO SURRENDERED.
IT'S DOWN TO US NOW.
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT
"AN ENTIRE ARMY,"
"A MECHA-GIANT,"
AND THAT CRAZY WEAPON?
"WE CAN'T FIGHT IT,"
"BUT MAYBE WE CAN CRIPPLE IT. ZHU LI,"
"WHEN YOU WERE SPYING ON KUVIRA,"
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT METAL MONSTER?
I HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE EVEN
BUILDING IT.
GUESS BAATAR JR. IS A BETTER
INVENTOR THAN I THOUGHT.
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.
THAT'S IT!
BAATAR JR. BUILT IT...
HE'LL KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT DOWN.
I SAY WE CAPTURE HIM AND
GET HIM TO TALK.
 HMM...
"I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT"
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE
 AND IF WE DON'T...
 KORRA. I'M IN.
WE'LL NEED A STEALTH TEAM OF
AIRBENDERS TO GET IN AND OUT
OF BAATAR'S AIRSHIP UNNOTICED.
"TENZIN, BUMI, JINORA, KAI..."
LET'S GET MOVING.
 WHAT ABOUT ME?
"SORRY BUDDY,"
BUT THIS MISSION COUNTS ON
EVERYONE BEING AS SILENT AS POSSIBLE.
AND YOUR FARTS ARE JUST
TOO MUCH OF A WILD CARD.
I CAN BE QUIET!
OKAY. POINT TAKEN.
 IS EVERYONE READY?
YOU'VE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
"ONCE KUVIRA FINDS OUT I'M MISSING,"
YOU'RE ALL DONE FOR.
"THAT'S WHY BEFORE SHE FINDS OUT,"
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US HOW TO
"STOP THAT MECHA-GIANT, OR ELSE..."
 OR ELSE WHAT?
YOU WON'T HURT ME.
I KNOW AN EMPTY THREAT WHEN
I SEE ONE.
 WAS THIS YOUR BEST IDEA?
"YOU'VE LOST, ONLY YOU HAVEN'T"
ACCEPTED IT YET.
 LET ME TALK TO HIM.
 ARE YOU SURE?
 CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
" JUST A MINUTE, SIR."
"I'M TELLING YOU, I LOOKED EVERYWHERE."
"ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WHISPERING."
I'M READY TO DISCUSS THE TERMS
OF THE SURRENDER WITH BAATAR JR.
 WHERE IS HE?
 UH...
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.
 BAATAR...
 IF YOU THINK I'M GOING
TO SPILL ALL MY SECRETS
"TO YOU, MOTHER,"
YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.
 WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I KNOW YOU SET OUT TO HELP
BETTER THE WORLD
BUT THIS IS MADNESS!
IT'S MADNESS TO LET OTHERS TAKE
WHAT'S YOURS AND ACCEPT IT BLINDLY.
THE UNITED REPUBLIC BELONGS TO US.
AND WE'RE TAKING IT BACK.
 BUT AT WHAT COST?
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE
THEIR LIVES
BEFORE KUVIRA IS SATISFIED?
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COST
ANY LIVES
IF YOU WOULD ALL JUST SURRENDER.
ALL THAT KUVIRA AND I WANT IS
A UNITED EARTH EMPIRE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
"TO HURT YOU,"
"BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, I'M SORRY."
"WHEN YOU LEFT ZAOFU,"
IT BROKE MY HEART.
AND OUR FAMILY HAS NEVER BEEN
THE SAME SINCE.
"PLEASE, BAATAR."
STOP ALL OF THIS AND COME HOME.
WE WANT YOU BACK WITH US.
 KUVIRA IS MY FAMILY NOW.
WE'RE GOING ABOUT THIS
ALL WRONG.
"YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO"
PHYSICALLY HURT YOU
IF YOU DON'T TALK.
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN DO
THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE PAINFUL.
I WILL TAKE AWAY THE ONE THING
YOU CARE FOR THE MOST...
KUVIRA.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 KUVIRA MIGHT WIN.
SHE MIGHT CHASE US OUT OF THE CITY.
BUT YOU WON'T BE AROUND TO
ENJOY THE VICTORY.
"BECAUSE WHEREVER I RUN, I'LL TAKE YOU."
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT MY LIFE'S
MISSION TO NEVER LET YOU
SEE THE ONE YOU LOVE AGAIN.
IS TAKING THE CITY WORTH
LOSING KUVIRA FOREVER?
 YOU CAN'T.
 I WILL.
UNLESS YOU CONVINCE
KUVIRA TO BACK OFF.
YOU TWO WILL STILL HAVE
"THE EARTH EMPIRE,"
JUST LEAVE THE UNITED REPUBLIC ALONE.
IT'S KUVIRA. SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO BAATAR.
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?
"FOR GOODNESS SAKE,"
GIVE ME THAT RADIO. LET ME TALK TO HER.
"KUVIRA, THIS IS RAIKO."
WHAT KIND OF GAME ARE YOU PLAYING?
YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD SEND
"BAATAR OVER WITH YOUR TERMS,"
AND THEN HE DOESN'T SHOW.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE DIDN'T SHOW?
"ACCORDING TO YOUR PEOPLE,"
HE'S NOT ON THE AIRSHIP.
IF HE'S NOT ON THE AIRSHIP
THEN WHERE IS HE?
"KUVIRA, IT'S BAATAR."
I'VE BEEN CAPTURED.
MY AIRSHIP WAS AMBUSHED
AND I WAS TAKEN BY FORCE.
KORRA REFUSES TO RELEASE ME
UNLESS WE BACK DOWN
AND LEAVE THE CITY.
 ARE YOU INJURED?
 I'M FINE.
IS THE AVATAR THERE
WITH YOU NOW?
 YES. EVERYONE IS HERE.
FIND OUT WHERE THAT RADIO
SIGNAL'S COMING FROM.
 LISTEN TO ME.
"IF YOU TRY TO TAKE REPUBLIC CITY,"
THE AVATAR WILL NEVER LET ME
SEE YOU AGAIN
AND I REFUSE TO LIVE THAT WAY.
FORGET THE UNITED REPUBLIC.
WE HAVE OUR EMPIRE.
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.
LET'S GO BACK HOME AND GET MARRIED.
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS THAT WE'RE TOGETHER
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
WE'VE IDENTIFIED THEIR POSITION.
"YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS CITY ISN'T WORTH"
SACRIFICING OUR LIFE TOGETHER.
"I LOVE YOU, BAATAR."
AS SOON AS WE WORK OUT TERMS
"WITH KUVIRA,"
WE'LL LET YOU OUT OF HERE.
GUYS!
SHE MUST HAVE OUR LOCATION!
SHE'S POINTING THAT
WEAPON RIGHT AT US.
" NO, SHE WOULDN'T..."
EVERYONE OUT! NOW! NOW!
 NO.
 KEEP THE PRESIDENT SAFE.
I'M GOING TO CHECK FOR SURVIVORS.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Water.
Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
The Earth Empire has invaded the United Republic!
"After Kuvira demonstrated the power of her spirit energy weapon,"
"President Raiko surrendered the city, but the Avatar refused to give up without a fight."
"Korra held Baatar Jr. hostage, hoping to force Kuvira to back down, but the plan failed, and she fired on team Avatar's hideout."
Can anything or anyone stop
Kuvira and her mecha-giant?
Go ahead. Take your time.
Just bending a giant wall.
"Man, we got a lot of people here."
Is that everybody?
Kuvira's heading our way with a platoon of mecha-suits.
What should we do?
"This is my hometown, and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing."
Let her take the city for now.
We'll think of some way to come back and beat her.
What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet?
If Kuvira finds out
"Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out."
I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu.
I'm not letting her conquer Republic City.
The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.
I agree.
We take down that giant today.
Lin!
Glad to see you all made it out.
You had me worried.
"Well, you benders are gonna have to fight her alone."
She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits.
Not all of them.
There are the prototypes back at my office.
"If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support."
"Su, you take Baatar Jr."
And the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office.
Get those suits working as soon as you can.
The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.
"Everyone, please settle down."
The trains should be returning to pick us up soon.
Tell that mecha-jerk to settle down.
She's the one blowing up the whole city!
"I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I just heard on the radio that Kuvira's army has destroyed the train tracks."
We're not getting out of the city by rail.
"Everyone, I was just up on the observation deck and saw a bunch of mecha-suit soldiers heading this way!"
"Oh, great!"
The giant one wasn't enough?
It's over!
We're all gonna get blown to bits!
"Listen, everyone."
I can get us out of here if you just sit tight.
"Can you step off the bench, please?"
It's a little crowded up here.
Sure. I'm only the conductor.
No one needs me on the bench.
Just stay calm.
I'll be right back. Come on!
"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Where are you going?
I'm going to get some help.
You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?
I raised Meelo.
I can handle anything.
A paint store? That's it!
"What are you doing, Meelo?"
I just got an idea how to beat the giant!
"Now everyone, grab some paint and find me some balloons!"
Airbenders approaching.
I see them.
Bombs away!
Clear the glass.
Now!
"The joints are platinum, too!"
We can't metalbend any of it!
"You're about to get the world's largest hot-foot, metal lady!"
Hit it now!
Opal!
"Everyone, retreat."
Take the wounded back to Asami's office.
I'll meet you there.
I'm going to see if I can find help.
All right. Let's fire it up again.
I can't stabilize it!
I thought you fixed the hydraulics.
I did!
Twist harder!
I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha-suits.
Kuvira's troops are headed this way!
"I know how to take down some mecha-suits, and it just might take down that giant, too!"
"Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back."
"Zhu Li, let's go."
Where am I?
Mom?
"Just rest, son."
I'm here.
"Mom, I'm so sorry."
I betrayed you... The whole family.
"I gave my life to Kuvira, and she just fired that weapon at me."
How could she do that?
"I don't know, sweetie."
She's a complicated person.
Wing and Wei will never forgive me.
And Opal...
"Yeah, they might take some time to come around, but we'll work through it as a family."
"Do you think this plan will actually work, sir?"
"I know I can stop the mecha-suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha-suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse."
"Zhu Li, I've been thinking."
"You're always thinking, sir."
"Yes, but lately,"
I've been thinking about you.
"I know we might not make it out of this mess, and I feel like there are some things I should tell you."
There are?
"I remember when I was a boy,"
I had an ostrich horse.
Named her Mrs. beaks.
I grew up on a farm.
"Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li?"
This was before the circus people took me away.
"Anyway, I loved old Mrs. beaks, but I took her for granted."
You'll have to finish your story later.
Kuvira's troops are in range.
Okay. I hope this works.
Yes! Dead in their tracks.
"Oh, rats."
She's still coming.
"Zhu Li, do the thing!"
I'm afraid there are no more things to do.
What was that?
An electromagnetic pulse.
"It shut down the mecha-suits, but our power source is fine."
Locate the source of the pulse.
That must be where Varrick is.
"Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep."
Capture anyone left in this city.
"Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha-suits but not the big one?"
Because it's powered with spirit vine energy.
I'm sorry.
"I wish I could help you, but it's unstoppable."
It's not.
Dad?
I got him out of jail to help.
I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now.
"If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in."
"I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City, and I would do anything to save her."
You think you know how to defeat this thing?
You must act like an infection:
Break the skin and attack the vital organs.
"Disconnect the heart and the brain, and this beast cannot live."
But how are we supposed to get inside?
Future industries has plasma saws for cutting platinum.
If we had one on the mecha-suit...
But the saws are way too big.
We'd never get the suits off the ground.
I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw.
Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.
Like a metal mosquito.
You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me?
I squash 'em!
We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits.
It looks like they're our only hope.

"Okay. Great job, everybody."
Who's got another song for us?
We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured or worse.
Should we play the button game?
Who has a button?
Where did these badgermoles come from?
The zoo!
"Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!"
"Well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?"
They're the best earthbenders around!
We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us!
Are you sure this is the best plan?
Let's follow the moles!

"Mech platoons, report."
Third platoon.
No sign of anyone so far.
Fourth platoon.
En route to train station.
I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse:
Future industries tower.
That's the place.
Kuvira is headed our way.
How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?
Just a few more minutes.
Get out there as soon as you can.
"If you do manage to get inside, find the engine room."
There are two emergency levers.
"If you switch them off at the same time, you'll cut the power."
Thanks.
"We may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down."
Let's go!
Jinora!
Whoa!

Halt.
"Turn around slowly, and please, stop that singing."
You are all Earth Empire prisoners.
Come with us and no one will get hurt.
You don't need these people.
"They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom."
Take me to Kuvira.
I've got business with her.
"No! Don't do it, Wu!"
I have to.
"But before I go,"
I'd like to sing you a song.

"If we stop that mecha-giant, it will all be because of you."
You're the one who designed these incredible suits.
It's great to be working together again.
"I love you, dad."
"I love you, too."
Zhu Li?
Yes?
I have something I need to attach before we take off.
Attach to what?
I need to attach this ring to your finger.
"Zhu Li moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?"
Yes.
Yes!
"Now, let's go attach these barely-functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!"
It's exactly how I always pictured our engagement.
"Aim for that spot in the middle of the back, the one I can never reach."
Got it.
Whaa! Let's get out of here.
Wow!
I wish I had that kind of flexibility.
Hang on!
I need more power!
They're cutting in!
More power!
We need to get out of here.
Almost there.
We have to go now!
Almost there. Almost there.
Dad! Now!
"Good-bye, Asami."
I love you.
Dad!
Hiroshi's plan worked.
There's our opening.
EARTH.
FIRE.
AIR.
WATER.
ONLY THE AVATAR CAN MASTER
ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
AND BRING BALANCE TO THE WORLD.
REPUBLIC CITY IS A WAR ZONE!
WHILE PRINCE WU LED THE
"REMAINING CITIZENS TO SAFETY,"
TEAM AVATAR BATTLED
"KUVIRA'S GIANT MECH,"
BUT NO AMOUNT OF BENDING
COULD BRING IT DOWN!
"IN A LAST DITCH EFFORT,"
ASAMI AND HER FATHER
OUTFITTED THE HUMMINGBIRD
SUITS WITH PLATINUM CUTTERS.
HIROSHI HELPED TEAM AVATAR
"INFILTRATE THE MECHA-GIANT,"
BUT HE PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.
IS VICTORY WITHIN REACH
FOR OUR HEROES?
 INITIATE LOCKDOWN.
FIND THE AVATAR
AND WHOEVER ELSE IS WITH HER.
 WE NEED TO MOVE FAST.
"SU, LIN, CLIMB UP TO THE ARM AND TRY"
TO DISABLE THAT WEAPON.
"MAKO, BOLIN, GET TO THE ENGINE"
AND SEE IF YOU CAN POWER
THIS THING DOWN.
I'M GOING AFTER KUVIRA.
 ARE YOU SURE?
WHEN YOU FOUGHT KUVIRA BEFORE...
I KNOW. SHE ALMOST DESTROYED ME.
NOT THIS TIME.
I'M GOING FOR THAT LEVER.
YOU GET THE OTHER ONE.
 HEY!
OOH!
I'LL DEAL WITH THIS GUY.
DISABLE THE WEAPON!
NICE WORK.
" THE OUTSIDE MAY BE PLATINUM,"
BUT WE CAN DO
A LOT OF DAMAGE IN HERE.
THE WEAPON'S LOADING
MECHANISM HAS MALFUNCTIONED.
 WE'RE UNABLE TO FIRE.
 IT'S NO MALFUNCTION.
I CAN FEEL SOMEONE
METALBENDING INSIDE THE ARM.
I LOST THE CONNECTION.
THE WEAPON'S USELESS NOW.
OOH!
 AH! UH!
AH!
UH!
 OOH-AH!
I'M READY!
BE WITH YOU IN ONE SECOND!
KIND OF BUSY!
 OOH-AH! UH!
 OKAY! READY NOW!
 ONE.
TWO.
THREE!
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.
KUVIRA MUST HAVE DONE
SOME OVERRIDE THING
AND TAKEN CONTROL!
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME OTHER WAY
TO SHUT DOWN POWER FROM HERE.
 UM...
 COME ON.
YOU SPENT ALL THAT TIME
WORKING WITH VARRICK AND BAATAR JR.
DIDN'T ANY OF THEIR GENIUS
RUB OFF ON YOU?
"LOOK, THE ONLY THING I KNOW"
ABOUT THESE VINES IS THAT
IF YOU MESS AROUND WITH THEM
"TOO MUCH, THEY EXPLODE."
GET THOSE ENGINEERS OUT OF HERE.
 I HAVE AN IDEA.
 WANT TO FILL ME IN?
I'M GONNA ZAP THESE VINES
WITH SOME ELECTRICITY.
" LET'S BACK IT UP, OKAY?"
I SAID THAT WILL MAKE
THE VINES EXPLODE.
 EXACTLY.
THIS IS OUR ONLY WAY
OF SHUTTING THIS THING DOWN.
 I CAN HANDLE IT.
" NO, YOU CAN'T."
THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO PROVE
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.
I ALREADY KNOW
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.
YOU'RE AWESOME.
 I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE.
"I'M DOING THIS, SO GET OUT OF HERE."
 OKAY.
"BUT FOR THE RECORD, I DO NOT APPROVE."
JUST GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
PROMISE?
 PROMISE.
 I LOVE YOU.
" I LOVE YOU, TOO."
NOW GO!
AAH-OOH!
 HA-AHH!
AH!
IT'S OVER.
YOU'RE GONNA CALL OFF YOUR ARMY
AND SURRENDER TO PRESIDENT RAIKO.
THEN YOU AND... UH!
STOP!
 KUVIRA! GIVE UP!
 NEVER.
"PLEASE, STOP THIS MADNESS!"
IT HAS TO END NOW!
"IF YOU REALLY WANT TO END IT,"
THEN COME AND GET ME!
 NOW IT'S OVER.
 DON'T!
SHUT IT DOWN!
 I CAN'T!
AH!
LOOK!
 A NEW SPIRIT PORTAL.
 SPREAD OUT AND FIND KUVIRA.
 KORRA!
"TENZIN, THERE'S NO SIGN OF HER."
 KEEP LOOKING.
KORRA! KORRA!
 UH-AHH!
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE WE DEAD?
 NO.
"WE'RE OKAY,"
BUT WE'RE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.
ALL THE ENERGY FROM YOUR
WEAPON TORE OPEN A NEW PORTAL
AND BLASTED US IN HERE.
WHY WOULD YOU SAVE MY LIFE?
AFTER EVERYTHING I DID TO YOU.
I GUESS I SEE
A LOT OF MYSELF IN YOU.
 WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE.
" YES, WE ARE."
WE'RE BOTH FIERCE
"AND DETERMINED TO SUCCEED,"
SOMETIMES WITHOUT
THINKING THINGS THROUGH.
THIS WASN'T
HOW I WANTED THINGS TO END.
"IF YOU HAD ALL JUST SURRENDERED,"
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED.
YOU BROUGHT THIS ON YOURSELF.
"MESSING WITH THE SPIRIT VINES,"
ACTING LIKE A DICTATOR
OVER YOUR PEOPLE...
YOU HAD TO KNOW WHAT YOU
WERE DOING WASN'T RIGHT.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP MY PEOPLE.
SU TURNED HER BACK
ON THE EARTH KINGDOM.
YOU WERE GONE. I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
 I THINK I GET IT NOW.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
 I DO.
SU TOLD ME HOW SHE TOOK YOU IN
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO HARD
BEING AN ORPHAN.
DON'T PRETEND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT FELT LIKE.
THE AVATAR IS ADORED BY MILLIONS!
"I WAS CAST ASIDE BY MY OWN PARENTS,"
LIKE I MEANT NOTHING TO THEM!
HOW COULD I JUST STAND BY AND
WATCH THE SAME THING HAPPEN
TO MY NATION WHEN IT NEEDED
SOMEONE TO GUIDE IT?
YOU WANTED TO CREATE A PLACE
WHERE YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
WOULD NEVER BE VULNERABLE AGAIN.
"I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AN ORPHAN,"
"BUT BELIEVE ME,"
I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO BE AFRAID.
"AFTER I WAS POISONED,"
I WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING
TO FEEL IN CONTROL.
 THE SPIRITS HAVE RETURNED.
 AND SO HAS KORRA!
 HA-HA! YOU'RE OKAY!
"RELEASE KUVIRA,"
OR WE WILL ATTACK.
 STAND DOWN.
THIS BATTLE IS OVER.
I OWE THE AVATAR MY LIFE.
HER POWER IS BEYOND ANYTHING
I COULD EVER HOPE TO ACHIEVE.
I'LL ACCEPT WHATEVER
PUNISHMENT THE WORLD SEES FIT.
"AND SU, I'M SORRY"
FOR ALL THE ANGUISH
I'VE CAUSED YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
 HA-HA!
 AND THOUGH THE BATTLE
TOOK A SEVERE TOLL
"ON OUR BELOVED CITY,"
"OUT OF THE DESTRUCTION,"
LOVE DID BLOOM.
"SO THAT IS WHY,"
"DEAREST FRIENDS AND FAMILY,"
WE GATHER TODAY TO CELEBRATE
THE WONDROUS
AND AT TIMES INEXPLICABLE BOND
BETWEEN SIR VARRICK
AND THE LADY ZHU LI!
" HEY, PAL."
CAMERA ON ME. THIS IS MY BIG DAY!
"TRUE LOVE IS A FICKLE CREATURE,"
"DIFFICULT TO FIND,"
"NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO TAME,"
BUT VARRICK AND ZHU LI HAVE PROVEN
THAT EVEN THE LONGEST OF LONG SHOTS
CAN HAVE A CHANCE
AT HAPPINESS TOGETHER.
NOW FOR THE VOWS!
"THANK YOU, MASTER PABU."
"DO YOU, SIR IKNIK BLACKSTONE VARRICK"
"OF THE SOUTHERN WATER TRIBE,"
"MASTER OF THE HIGH SEAS,"
TAKE THE LADY ZHU LI MOON TO
BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE?
WILL YOU PROMISE TO TREAT HER
NOT AS YOUR ASSISTANT
BUT AS YOUR HONORED
AND CHERISHED PARTNER?
 YOU'RE DARN TOOTIN' I DO!
"AND DO YOU, ZHU LI, TAKE VARRICK"
TO BE YOUR
LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND?
DO YOU PROMISE TO CARE FOR HIM
"IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH,"
AND...
AND ALSO SCRUB HIS CALLUSES
"ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS,"
WHICH ISN'T REALLY THAT MUCH TO ASK.
"OKAY, I'M NOT READING ALL THIS."
" I DO TAKE VARRICK,"
CALLUSES AND ALL.
 YOU MAY NOW DO THE THING.
 OH!
 ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU JUST MAKE ME SO DANG HAPPY.
MY COUSIN TOLD ME
HOW LEVEL-HEADED YOU WERE
DURING THE WHOLE EVACUATION.
"I GOT TO ADMIT, I'M IMPRESSED."
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
"A GREAT LEADER,"
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
"I'M GONNA SET YOU UP WITH KORRA,"
SO DON'T ASK.
" THAT'S OKAY, MAKO."
"SOMETIMES, A GOOD EVACUATION"
IS ITS OWN REWARD.
"GOOD TO SEE YOU, PRINCE WU..."
OR SHOULD I SAY KING WU?
YOU READY TO GET BACK TO BA SING SE
AND FINALLY TAKE THE THRONE?
 YEAH... ABOUT THAT.
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
OF STEPPING DOWN AS KING
AND GETTING RID OF
THE MONARCHY ALTOGETHER.
 ARE YOU JOKING?
" FOR ONCE, I'M NOT."
"NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY:"
"I'M BEING LAZY,"
"I'M AFRAID OF RESPONSIBILITY,"
I'M PUTTING MY SINGING CAREER
"BEFORE MY PEOPLE,"
BUT IT'S NONE OF THOSE THINGS.
I REALLY THINK THE EARTH
KINGDOM WOULD BE BETTER OFF
IF THE STATES WERE INDEPENDENT
AND HAD ELECTED LEADERS
LIKE THE UNITED REPUBLIC.
THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY WISE
AND MATURE OF YOU.
 I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
"THE EARTH KINGDOM SHOULD EVOLVE,"
AND I'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO HELP YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
LOOKING FORWARD
"TO WORKING WITH YOU,"
"BUT FOR NOW, THE DANCE FLOOR CALLS!"
 HOW'S THE ARM?
 MUCH BETTER.
" THE WORDS ""THANK YOU"""
DON'T FEEL BIG ENOUGH
"FOR WHAT YOU DID,"
BUT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'LL FOLLOW YOU INTO BATTLE
NO MATTER HOW CRAZY THINGS GET.
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK AND I ALWAYS WILL.
 I SPOKE TO PRESIDENT RAIKO.
"TOMORROW, HE'S ANNOUNCING"
A PLAN TO EXPAND THE CITY
RATHER THAN REBUILD DOWNTOWN.
I BET AANG
NEVER COULD'VE IMAGINED
THERE'D BE A SPIRIT PORTAL
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF REPUBLIC CITY.
"KORRA, YOU'VE TRANSFORMED"
THE WORLD MORE IN A FEW YEARS
THAN MOST AVATARS DID
DURING THEIR LIFETIMES.
BUT I FEEL
LIKE I'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN.
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
I WANT TO LEARN AND DO.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY I AM
TO HEAR YOU SO FULL OF HOPE AGAIN.
IT'S BEEN A BIT
"OF A BUMPY RIDE, HUH?"
I'VE COME TO REALIZE
LIFE IS ONE BIG BUMPY RIDE.
I KNOW I WAS IN A PRETTY DARK
"PLACE AFTER I WAS POISONED,"
BUT I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
I HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT.
I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT TRUE SUFFERING WAS
SO I COULD BECOME
"MORE COMPASSIONATE TO OTHERS,"
EVEN TO PEOPLE LIKE KUVIRA.
" EXCUSE ME, TENZIN."
VARRICK IS LOOKING FOR YOU.
SOMETHING ABOUT WANTING TO BORROW
A GLIDER SUIT TO FLY OFF THE TOWER.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
WANT TO SIT WITH ME
FOR A MINUTE?
I'M NOT READY TO GET BACK
TO THE PARTY JUST YET.
I DON'T THINK I EVER
REALLY APOLOGIZED.
 FOR WHAT?
 FOR BEING GONE ALL THAT TIME.
FOR NOT COMING BACK SOONER.
YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING.
I'M JUST SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE NOW.
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE HANDLED
LOSING YOU AND MY FATHER
IN THE SAME DAY.
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
 THANK YOU.
I'M JUST GLAD
I WAS ABLE TO FORGIVE HIM.
SO WHAT NOW?
BACK TO THE DANCE FLOOR?
 I'M KIND OF ALL DANCED OUT.
"HONESTLY, AFTER"
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
"THE PAST FEW MONTHS,"
I COULD USE A VACATION.
 LET'S DO IT.
"LET'S GO ON A VACATION,"
"JUST THE TWO OF US,"
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.
 REALLY?
OKAY.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE
WHAT THE SPIRIT WORLD'S LIKE.
 SOUNDS PERFECT.
