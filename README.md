ATLA - Avatar the LOD Archive aims to represent the rich interconnections characterizing the Avatar's universe, mostly focusing on real life elements that inspired some of the main cultural influences that shaped this setting and the evolution of its plot. 

We implemented components of Linked Open Data, available on the Internet, and a Knowledge Graph was realized to better explicit and visualize meaningful relationships. 

Linguistic Analysis was another core proceeding of the development, since it allowed us to delve into the information provided by the show itself in the most efficient approach possible. 

Formal and Informal Competency have, moreover, been formulated and tested with the elaborated Graph Queries.


The purpose of this project is to present our engagement in ontology design, text extraction and analysis on the Avatar universe, as an end-of-course project for the “Knowledge Representation and Extraction ” course of the Master's Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna, under our professors Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese and Aldo Gangemi. The different corpora contained in this website have been selected and extracted for this academic goal.
